"""Leak-soak: the memory store must stay BOUNDED under sustained churn.

This is the executable form of the operator requirement "no memory leaks".
We hammer the store with thousands of add/recall/prune cycles and assert that
node and edge counts converge to the cap rather than growing with the step
count — and that pruning a node drops its edges (no dangling references that
would silently leak).

Pure stdlib + the in-memory reference backend, so it runs in CI in well under a
second. The same assertions will later be run against the Postgres backend
under the `integration` marker to prove the SQL DELETE + VACUUM path is equally
leak-bounded.
