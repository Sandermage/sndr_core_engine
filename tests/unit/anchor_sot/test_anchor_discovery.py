"""Ф1 — anchor_discovery R1 coverage tests.

R1: discovery must enumerate ALL anchor-bearing patches (no hand-typed subset).
Discovery requires a vLLM source tree (the patchers build against it); when
vLLM is absent (local dev box) the discovery yields ~nothing and the test
skips — the authoritative R1 proof runs on the rig / CI where dev148 vLLM is
installed (see the §-server-test in the implementation plan).
