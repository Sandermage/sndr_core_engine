"""DA-002 (audit 2026-05-08): regression guard for `_per_patch_dispatch.py`
NameError-class bugs.

The legacy parking-lot module hand-codes 124+ wrappers shaped like:

    @register_patch("P4 TurboQuant hybrid model support")
    def apply_patch_4_tq_hybrid() -> PatchResult:
        ...
        from vllm.sndr_core.integrations.scheduler import p4_tq_hybrid
        ...
        status, reason = p4_tq_hybrid.apply()    # ← MUST match imported name

Until 2026-05-08 audit, several wrappers had the imported symbol
(`p4_tq_hybrid`) named differently from the call (`patch_4_tq_hybrid`),
producing `NameError` only at dry-run time. Because dry-run is the
installer smoke path, this surfaced as `install --dry-run` exit 2 in
production with a spurious "wiring import failed" reason.

This test enforces the contract by:

  1. Walking every `apply_patch_<N>_<...>()` wrapper via AST.
  2. Extracting its `from ... import <X>` statements.
  3. Asserting that any `<symbol>.apply()` call inside the wrapper
     uses one of the imported names — never `patch_<N>_<...>` unless
     that exact name is what was imported.

Why AST instead of just running every wrapper:
  - Wrappers may try to import torch-heavy modules; AST is cold-import safe.
  - We're checking the SHAPE of the code, not its runtime behavior — the
    legacy parking lot is being phased out via spec-driven dispatch
    (PR38 Day 6-8), so a runtime-execution test would be retiring the
    same time as the parking lot itself.
