"""Iron rule #11 enforcement — retire/supersession provenance.

Sander 2026-05-11 strategic mandate (codified in skill v2 iron rule #11):
when an upstream PR supersedes a Genesis patch, we either retire it
(byte-equivalent) or update it (we do MORE). Either way the registry
entry must carry explicit provenance:

  - `superseded_by`:    string explaining the supersession (PR + outcome)
  - `vllm_version_range`: PEP 440 spec gating the pin range where the
                           original patch was valid (upper bound = pin
                           where upstream's equivalent landed)

Without these, future maintainers reading the registry have no audit
trail of WHY a patch is retired, on WHICH pins it applies, or what to
verify when bumping further. This test enforces the discipline.

What this test rejects (will fail the suite):
  1. lifecycle="retired" without BOTH superseded_by AND vllm_version_range
  2. superseded_by present without vllm_version_range (except legacy
     auto-apply patches whose synthetic GENESIS_LEGACY_* flag doesn't
     fire pin-gate anyway — those are cosmetically OK to omit)

What this test allows (xfail / known waivers):
  - lifecycle="legacy" patches with superseded_by but no pin-gate
    (synthetic env_flag → pin-gate adds no behavioral effect, just
    documentation; cosmetic gap, low priority)

How to fix a failure:
  - Add `superseded_by`: short string naming the upstream PR + state
    (e.g. `"vllm#41268 (merged 2026-04-30, byte-equivalent on dev209)"`)
  - Add `vllm_version_range`: tuple or string declaring the upper bound
    (e.g. `"<0.20.2rc1.dev93"` for patches superseded before dev93)
  - If the patch is retired but no upstream supersession (e.g. hypothesis
    disproven, or retired pending refactor) — document that in the
    `notes`/`credit` field and add a `_RETIRED_NO_SUPERSEDE_WAIVER`
    constant below for explicit waiver.

Adding a new retired patch?
  - Always set BOTH superseded_by and vllm_version_range, OR
  - Add the patch ID to _RETIRED_NO_SUPERSEDE_WAIVER below with a brief
    reason in the docstring there.
