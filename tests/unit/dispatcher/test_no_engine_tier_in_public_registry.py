"""CI-wide regression guard — no `tier="engine"` entries in this
public sndr_core PATCH_REGISTRY.

Iron Rule #1: this repo is `sndr_core` (public, Apache 2.0). Engine-tier
patches live in the separate private `sndr_engine` repo. A
`tier="engine"` entry in this registry is a policy violation AND a
silent-failure bug — the `_check_tier_gate` in
vllm/sndr_core/dispatcher/decision.py requires both:

  - the commercial `vllm.sndr_engine` package present
  - a valid `SNDR_ENGINE_LICENSE_KEY` env or `~/.sndr/license.json`
  - sndr_engine major version matches sndr_core

Without those, the patch silently skips with reason "tier=engine:
vllm.sndr_engine not installed". Operators who enable the
`GENESIS_ENABLE_*` env flag see no apply error in boot logs — just
a `skipped` entry buried in the per-patch chatter. The feature is
DEAD without anyone noticing.

v11.3.0 bug discovered: PN289 (§6.H10 Prometheus process-info gauge)
was registered as `tier="engine"` but its implementation lives at
`vllm/sndr_core/observability/genesis_process_info.py` (public,
Apache 2.0). Fixed to `tier="community"` in the same commit as this
test. Every operator who set `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN289_PROCESS_INFO=1`
to get §6.H10 enterprise observability before this fix got a silent
no-op — no `genesis_process_info` gauge in their Prometheus.

This test pins the boundary so the same class of bug can't return.

Allowlist via `_KNOWN_ENGINE_TIER_ENTRIES` if a future patch genuinely
requires engine-tier (would also need to live in sndr_engine repo,
not here). Empty at v11.3.0.
