"""CI-wide regression guard — no DRIFT entries in the legacy↔spec
divergence audit (v12.0.0 readiness gate).

Why this matters
----------------

The dispatcher migration plan (master plan §3 Phase 4, §13 follow-up #7)
targets v12.0.0 to flip the default apply path from legacy
`@register_patch(...)` iteration to spec-driven
`iter_patch_specs()` dispatch. For that flip to be safe, every patch
the legacy path applies must be either:

  (a) ALSO applied by spec-driven path (covered by an iter-yielded
      spec with apply_module set), OR
  (b) DELIBERATELY skipped by spec-driven path via the
      `GENESIS_LEGACY_*` env_flag policy (spec entry exists with
      apply_module=None and env_flag starts with GENESIS_LEGACY_).

Any legacy-only patch that doesn't fit (b) is `DRIFT` — a real
migration gap that would silently disable the patch on v12.0.0 flip.

v11.3.0 baseline (BUG #6 audit, this commit): 0 drift entries,
7 intentional legacy (P1, P17, P18b, P20, P23, P29, P32). The
audit script's `_diff_matrices` classifies them; this test pins
`drift_count == 0`.

Author: Sandermage (Sander) Barzov Aleksandr, Ukraine, Odessa.
Status: v11.3.0+ regression guard.

    """v11.3.0 baseline for spec-only-truly-orphan patches — those
    that apply ONLY through the spec-driven path (SNDR_APPLY_VIA_SPECS=1).

    Why pin: an operator who enables one of these via env (e.g.
    `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN289_PROCESS_INFO=1`) without also setting
    `SNDR_APPLY_VIA_SPECS=1` gets a silent no-op. Bug class #5 + #7
    from the v11.3.0 audit-driven discovery sweep.

    Either:
      (a) add a legacy `@register_patch` hook in
          `sndr/apply/_per_patch_dispatch.py`, or
      (b) add a manual orchestration call in
          `sndr/plugin.py`, or
      (c) accept the orphan state — document in this baseline so a
          NEW orphan addition (not part of baseline) triggers review.

    Baseline at v11.3.0 (BUG #7 audit):
      - PN288: tool finish_reason override (not in any production YAML)
      - PN289: §6.H10 Prometheus process_info gauge (BUG #4 just-fixed
               tier=community; not in any production YAML)
      - PN40-classifier: DFlash sub-D workload classifier hook
        (env GENESIS_ENABLE_PN40_DFLASH_OMNIBUS — IS in production
        DFlash YAMLs, but the same env enables PN40 omnibus which
        has a legacy hook; classifier currently routes through there
        too — BUG #8 audit follow-up).

    v12 baseline expansion (accepted orphan state, option (c)):
      - The v11 import-time manual orchestration block
        (`vllm/sndr_core/__init__.py`, ~41 env-gated `mod.apply()`
        calls) was archived in commit 6bf9c04c
        (`sndr_private/archive/v11_vllm_sndr_core_shims/`) and NOT
        carried into `sndr/`. Of its modules, only G4_19/G4_19b kept
        manual orchestration (selective apply in `sndr/plugin.py`);
        the rest now apply ONLY via SNDR_APPLY_VIA_SPECS=1:
        G4_31, G4_32, G4_60A-L Gemma4 TQ overlays, G4_67, G4_69,
        G4_71-76 drafter patches, G4_78 (retired bridge), and the
        spec-decode probes PN262/PN262B/PN271. All are env-gated
        diagnostics/Gemma4-specific patches absent from production
        Qwen YAMLs — silent no-op risk accepted until they get spec
        hooks or retirement.
      - PN353B, PN357: June 2026 vendor-wave patches registered
        spec-only from birth (no legacy hook by design — they ride
        the v12 spec-driven path).
      - G4_80, PN371, PN373: 2026-06-11 50-PR sweep wave 1 patches
        registered spec-only from birth (same class as PN353B/PN357;
        their wave siblings PN370/PN372/PN374/PN375 DID get legacy
        parking-lot hooks). All opt-in env-gated, absent from
        production Qwen YAMLs today.

    NOTE (2026-06-11): the audit script's `spec_only_truly_orphan_ids`
    cap was raised 30 → 60 when this baseline crossed 30 entries —
    the test compares the FULL set and a 30-cap silently truncated it
