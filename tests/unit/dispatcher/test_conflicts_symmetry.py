"""`conflicts_with` MUST be a symmetric relation across the registry.

If patch A declares `conflicts_with: [B]`, then patch B must also list A.
Otherwise: when user enables B first then A, the dispatcher silently allows
both — the conflict check only fires from the side that DECLARED it.

Background — 2026-05-12 audit found `PN79.conflicts_with: [PN59, PN54]`
but neither PN59 nor PN54 listed PN79 back. Both fixed in registry; this
test prevents the regression class.

Also asserts: cross-references in `conflicts_with` / `requires_patches` /
`composes_with` point to patch IDs that actually exist in the registry.
