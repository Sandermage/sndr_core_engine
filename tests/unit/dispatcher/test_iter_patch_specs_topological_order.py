"""CI-wide regression guard — `iter_patch_specs(topo_sort=True)` yields
patches in a valid topological order respecting `requires_patches`.

Why this matters
----------------

The spec-driven apply orchestrator iterates `iter_patch_specs()` and
applies each patch's `apply_module` in iteration order. If a patch
declares `requires_patches=[<X>]`, that means `<X>` must have its
apply_module run BEFORE the dependent patch. The legacy
`@register_patch` decorator-order doesn't enforce this — and at the
v11.3.0 baseline, 6 spec entries have a `requires_patches` constraint
that the natural registry-insertion order violates:

  - PN105 requires PN104 (insertion has PN105 before PN104)
  - PN34  requires PN33  (PN34 before PN33)
  - G4_75 requires G4_74 (G4_75 before G4_74)
  - G4_70 requires G4_69 (G4_70 before G4_69)
  - PN256 requires G4_67 (PN256 before G4_67)
  - G4_69 requires G4_60K (G4_69 before G4_60K)

These would result in dependent patches running against
un-monkey-patched targets — broken/undefined behavior.

The fix: `iter_patch_specs(topo_sort=True)` uses Kahn's algorithm
with insertion-order tie-breaking to yield a stable topological
order. The spec-driven orchestrator opts in via env
`SNDR_TOPO_SORT_SPECS=1`. Default OFF to preserve current behavior
for the staged v12.0.0 rollout.

This test pins two invariants:
  1. `topo_sort=True` output has ZERO order violations
  2. `topo_sort=False` (default) reproduces the registry-insertion
     order with the known violations as documented baseline
