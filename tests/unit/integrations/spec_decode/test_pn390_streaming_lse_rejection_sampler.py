"""PN390 — streaming-LSE rejection sampler (vendor of vllm#45369).

Contract pinned here (TDD, written alongside the implementation):
  1. Patcher carries 13 required sub-patches: the import HAS_TRITON add,
     the body softmax→LSE swap, three call-site swaps, the wrapper
     signature, the injected compute_target_lse + target_lse_kernel
     producer, and the two-kernel signature/load rewrites that
     reconstruct probabilities as exp(logit - lse).
  2. KERNEL/SAMPLER ONLY: the module never touches scheduler.py or any
     torch-side prob reader — PN369's torch-side prob read is explicitly
     out of scope (documented in the module).
  3. Deliberate spelling divergence for drift-marker hygiene: our body
     constant is GENESIS_PN390_LSE_BLOCK_SIZE (never the bare
     `BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr = 8192`) and the LSE store is factored
     through a named `lse` intermediate (never the upstream one-liner),
     so #45369's exact lines stay usable as drift markers without
     colliding with our own emitted text (lint_drift_markers contract).
  4. apply() on the pin-form (g303916e93) installs all 13 sub-patches,
     removes the materialized target_probs softmax, and the result
     compiles.
  5. Second apply() is idempotent (marker short-circuit).
  6. apply() on #45369's merged form self-skips via drift markers
     (reason: upstream_merged) without touching the file.
  7. Drift markers do not collide with PN390's own replacement text or
     its Layer-6 marker line (tools/lint_drift_markers.py contract)
     AND at least one marker is an exact substring of the merged form.
  8. Anchors are unique and drift markers absent in the pristine pin
     tree (opportunistic — skipped when the pin tree is not present).
  9. The module documents the live exposure (MTP K=3, vocab 151936
     transient 3.6-14.6 MB), the PN378 line-orthogonality, the PN369
     out-of-scope note, and references GENESIS_ENABLE_PN390_STREAMING_LSE_SAMPLER.
