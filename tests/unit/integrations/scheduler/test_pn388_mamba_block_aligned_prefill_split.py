"""PN388 — mamba-block-aligned intermediate prefill split (vendor of vllm#45477).

Contract pinned here (TDD, written before the implementation):

  1. Patcher carries the dual-anchor variant set for the one rewrite site
     (``Scheduler._mamba_block_aligned_split`` in v1/core/sched/scheduler.py):
       * a PRISTINE-shaped variant (pin g303916e93, P34 disabled), and
       * a POST-P34-shaped variant (the same block after the effectively
         always-on P34 zero-collapse guard has expanded the first branch).
     Both are ``required=False`` with required-at-least-one semantics
     (mirrors the P85-on-PN346 dual-anchor convention); exactly one
     matches any given file by construction.

  2. The replacement is the PR #45477 flat form (round_down on the chunk
     END, not the chunk LENGTH) WITHOUT the PR's Marconi
     ``num_uncached_common_prefix_tokens`` tail — that parameter does not
     exist in our pin's function signature (documented Genesis divergence,
     iron rule #10).

  3. The fix removes the LIVE prefix-cache poison: every NON-FINAL prefill
     chunk ends on a mamba block boundary; a budget-fragmented first chunk
     defers (``num_new_tokens == 0``) instead of ending mid-block. The
     final unaligned prompt tail is still allowed.

  4. apply() on either pin form (pristine or post-P34) installs the rewrite,
     keeps the trailing ``return num_new_tokens``, and the file still
     compiles. Second apply() is idempotent (marker short-circuit).

  5. apply() on #45477's merged form self-skips via drift markers
     (reason: upstream_merged) without touching the file.

  6. Drift markers do not collide with PN388's own replacement text or its
     Layer-6 marker line (tools/lint_drift_markers.py self-collision
     contract) AND at least one marker is an exact substring of the merged
     form.

  7. Coexistence with P34: PN388 anchors on the POST-P34 shape (P34
     boot-dispatches first via requires_patches), and the module references
     the registry env flag GENESIS_ENABLE_PN388_MAMBA_BLOCK_ALIGNED_SPLIT.

  8. Behavioural oracle: a pure-Python re-implementation of the patched
     arithmetic, run through a fragmenting-budget prefill loop on the exact
     PROD shape (prompt 2002, mamba block 1600, eagle on), produces only
     block-aligned non-final chunk ends — while the unpatched pin+P34 form
     produces unaligned non-final ends (the poison).
