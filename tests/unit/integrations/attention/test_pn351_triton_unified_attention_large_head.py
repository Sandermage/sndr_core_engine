"""PN351 — Triton unified_attention head_dim>=512 tune (vendor of vllm#43257).

Contract pinned here (TDD, written before the dual-anchor implementation):

Pin-bump protection (the reason this batch-3 task exists), corrected
2026-06-13 against the REAL upstream-main launch shape after review:

  THREE launch-site shapes exist in the wild (verified against the live
  pin + raw upstream ``main`` + ``gh pr diff 45151``):

    (A) CURRENT pin g303916e93: tail ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n    )`` — NO
        ``**launch_kwargs`` line. The only shape we run today.
    (B) Upstream ``main`` BEFORE #45151: main refactored the launch to
        splat a tuned-params dict, so the tail is
        ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n        **launch_kwargs,\n    )``.
    (C) Upstream ``main`` AFTER #45151 (FP8 group-quant fused into the
        epilogue): the 7 new kwargs are spliced between ``USE_TD_QO`` and
        the existing ``**launch_kwargs,`` CONTEXT line, so the tail is
        ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n<7 kwargs>\n        **launch_kwargs,\n    )``.

  The original single-form ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n    )`` anchor matches
  ONLY shape (A); both future shapes (B, C) end with ``**launch_kwargs,``
  before the ``)`` and silently break it — PN351 would lose its -3-7%
  decode_TPOT win on Gemma 4 on the first main-descended pin bump.

The fix is a MULTI-ANCHOR launch sub-patch (P18B/PN32 chain convention —
required-at-least-one):
  1. Three launch variants, all ``required=False``:
       - current-pin variant: anchor ends ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n    )``.
       - upstream-main variant: anchor ends
         ``USE_TD_QO=use_td_qo,\n        **launch_kwargs,\n    )``.
       - post-#45151 variant: anchor ends on the last of the 7 inserted
         kwargs (``USE_UE8M0=output_group_ue8m0,``) + ``**launch_kwargs,``.
     On any given pin EXACTLY ONE matches; the others soft-skip. In B and
     C our literal kwargs are inserted BEFORE ``**launch_kwargs,`` (main's
     splat is empty on head_dim>=512, so no num_warps conflict).
  2. The tile sub-patch stays ``required=True`` (its function is byte-
     identical on the current pin AND upstream main, so its anchor never
     breaks).
  3. apply() enforces "at least one launch variant applied" — a tile-only
     apply is incoherent (Sub-1 sets the tile, the launch sets the config;
     either alone is a no-op functional regression), so PN351 must FAIL
     loudly rather than report a half-applied success.

Behavior is UNCHANGED — all launch variants emit the same
``num_warps=8 if head_size >= 512 else 4`` / ``num_stages=2 if head_size
>= 512 else 3`` kwargs. Only the anchor robustness changes.

Drift-marker hygiene (lint_drift_markers.py self-collision contract):
  the drift markers must never be substrings of PN351's own emitted text.
  PN351's marker uses the prefix ``[Genesis PN351`` (defended convention,
  exempt) — verified here so the lint stays 0 across the bump.
