"""PN367 — CUDA graph memory estimate clamp (vendor of vllm#44745).

History: PN367 originally vendored OPEN vllm#45076 (Oxygen56). On
2026-06-10 the author CLOSED #45076 and consolidated into #44745
(same clamp + the 1 MiB first-capture floor + unit tests, still OPEN).
PN367 v2 tracks #44745's merged form for drift detection and vendors
the floor for full parity.

Contract pinned here (TDD, written before the v2 implementation):
  1. Runner patcher carries TWO sub-patches: the required decoder
     mem-sample clamp and the optional first-capture 1 MiB floor.
  2. apply() on pin-form (g303916e93) targets installs clamp + floor +
     the worker final non-negative guard.
  3. Second apply() is idempotent (marker short-circuit).
  4. apply() on #44745's merged form self-skips via drift markers
     (reason: upstream_merged) — the previous v1 markers could NEVER
     match the real merged code (#44745 writes
     ``mem_samples.append(max(delta, 0))``, not the v1 marker text).
  5. Drift markers do not collide with PN367's own replacement texts
     or its Layer-6 marker line (lint_drift_markers contract).
  6. Anchors are unique and drift markers absent in the pristine pin
     tree (opportunistic — skipped when the pin tree is not present).

# inflated the suite with a permanent green-by-skip. PN367 is NOT recorded in
# the committed anchor_sot manifest (its ``_make_runner_patcher`` /
# ``_make_worker_patcher`` builders emit no anchor target at manifest-gen
# time — the 90/329 coverage gap, audit #6/#21), so the byte-check cannot be
# migrated onto the manifest the way the recorded patches were. Retired here;
# the anchor uniqueness/idempotency/self-collision contract stays covered in
# CI by TestPatcherShape + TestApply (synthetic sources) +
# TestDriftMarkerSelfCollision above. Re-add a manifest assertion once a pin
# rebuild records PN367.
