"""GUI ↔ backend contract gate.

The GUI's `api.ts` hand-writes the daemon route paths it calls. This test pins
those paths against the backend's actual routes so a renamed/removed backend
route (or a typo'd GUI path) fails CI instead of 404-ing at runtime — the
structural-compatibility guard for the two halves of the project.

The v11→v12 migration split routes across two factories — the legacy monolith
(the full Control Center) and the modular ``server`` (persistent memory + the
migrated routes). ``unified.create_app`` COMPOSES them into one superset daemon
(legacy + memory), so a single deployment serves every GUI path. This gate pins
the GUI's paths against that unified daemon — the app the full-Control-Center
deployment runs — so a renamed backend route or typo'd GUI path fails CI instead
of 404-ing. A second test pins the ``/api/v1/memory/*`` routes to the modular
``server`` factory (what the ``genesis-memory`` container runs), so memory drift
is caught at its real source too.

It extracts every ``/api/...`` literal from api.ts, reduces each to its static
prefix (dropping ``${…}`` path params and ``${query(…)}`` suffixes), and checks a
backend route has that prefix segment-wise (``{param}`` segments are wildcards).
Skips cleanly if the GUI source isn't present (e.g. a backend-only checkout)."""
