"""Test-session setup for `tests/unit/infra/` — STABLE-ratchet support.

The STABLE ratchet test (`test_stable_manifest_policy.py`) asserts that
every `lifecycle="stable"` patch has its TextPatcher registered in
`wiring/patcher_registry.py::iter_registered_patchers()`. Wiring modules
register via `register_for_manifest(pristine_root=...)` rather than at
import time — same mechanism `scripts/build_anchor_manifest.py` uses to
build the on-disk manifest.

This conftest invokes those `register_for_manifest()` calls once per
test session so the ratchet test sees the same patcher set as the
build script. Without this, the registry is empty and any STABLE
patch fails the registration check vacuously.

Discovery list mirrors `scripts/build_anchor_manifest.py::_trigger_patcher_registration`.
