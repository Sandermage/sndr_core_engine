"""PR38 §5.5 (audit closure 2026-05-08) — `lifecycle="stable"` ratchet.

The PR38_PATCHER_REWORK_PLAN_2026-05-07.md §5.5 mandates anchor manifest
coverage for "stable" patches. Closing this finding via a self-enforcing
policy ratchet rather than mass migration:

  Policy:
    Any registry entry with `lifecycle="stable"` MUST have:
      (a) all its TextPatcher instances declare `patch_id="<X>.Sub-<N>"`,
      (b) all those patch_ids registered in `wiring/patcher_registry.py`,
      (c) the target file present in `manifests/anchor_manifest.json`,
      (d) the registered patcher's anchors covered by the manifest.

  Today: 0 patches have lifecycle="stable" → tests pass vacuously.
  Future: when an operator promotes a patch (e.g. PN79 experimental →
          stable after multi-turn validation), THIS test fails until
          the 4 conditions above are met. That forces the
          STABLE_PROMOTION_CHECKLIST steps to actually happen — no
          drift between "marked stable" and "manifest-covered".

Why ratchet over upfront migration:
  - 0 patches are stable today (lifecycle distribution: 91 <none>,
    31 legacy, 5 retired, 3 experimental, 1 coordinator, 0 stable).
  - Mass-migrating 6 high-anchor candidates would commit ~150ms boot
    speedup but add 6 pristine fixture files → maintenance burden on
    every vllm pin upgrade.
  - The ratchet makes promotion to stable contingent on manifest
    coverage being ready — strictly stronger than mass migration
    because it covers ALL future stable patches, not just today's
    top-6 by anchor count.
