"""Pin the apply_all.py ↔ dispatcher.py PATCH_REGISTRY sync contract.

For every patch that has an `@register_patch` + `apply_patch_<id>_*`
function in `apply_all.py`, there must be a corresponding entry in
`PATCH_REGISTRY` in `dispatcher.py` (and vice versa, with one
documented exception for P68/P69 sharing one apply function).

Why this matters: without this gate, the legacy P1–P46 patches drifted
out of the registry for an entire phase of development. New patches
can land in apply_all without dispatcher metadata (no env_flag, no
schema validation, invisible to `genesis explain` and `genesis list`).
This test catches that drift on every commit.
