"""Wiring for PN79 — in-place SSM state for GDN chunk prefill (vllm#41824 backport).

================================================================
What it does
================================================================

Backport of vllm-project/vllm#41824 (Kermit-C, OPEN as of 2026-05-07).
Eliminates per-decode-step gather (`ssm_state[indices].contiguous()`) and
scatter (`ssm_state[indices] = final_state`) copies in the GDN chunk
prefill path, by passing `ssm_state_indices` directly to the Triton kernel.
Kernel uses `IS_CONTINUOUS_BATCHING` constexpr to read/write the global
SSM cache pool in-place via pointer arithmetic.

Author claims 4.5–36 GiB cumulative fp32 traffic eliminated per multi-turn
session (Qwen3.5-0.8B → Qwen3.6-27B scale).

================================================================
Architecture decision: Variant 1 (clean #41824 port) vs Variant 2 (bundle PN59)
================================================================

Choice: **Variant 1** — clean port of #41824, no PN59 streaming-dispatch
bundling. Reasoning (full justification in `docs/_internal/research/`):

1. **Empirical: PN59 streaming dead code on real workload.** Verified
   2026-05-06 evening on 27B+TQ k8v4: streaming-GDN dispatcher bypasses
   on every chunked-prefill chunk (T=64 ≤ threshold=1024) and every
   multi-seq batch. Streaming `_streaming_path` invocations: ZERO under
   our serving pattern.

2. **Occam's razor**: bundling PN59 mechanism into PN79 = adding code
   that empirically never executes. Anti-pattern.

3. **Maintenance burden**: clean port = direct upstream sync when
   #41824 merges. Bundled variant = permanent Genesis divergence.

4. **Decoupling preserves option value**: PN59 stays as separate
   `lifecycle: deprecated` patch. If future workload needs streaming
   (e.g., `--no-chunked-prefill` mode), re-enable PN59 separately —
   not coupled to PN79's apply state.

PN59 + PN54 → INTENDED for `lifecycle: deprecated` / `retired` after
multi-turn evidence proves PN79 win. As of 2026-05-07 both remain
`lifecycle: stable` in dispatcher.PATCH_REGISTRY — migration deferred
until Stage 4 evidence (Cliff 2 multi-turn reproducer + memory traffic
profiler). conflicts_with [PN59, PN54] in PN79 registry entry enforces
mutual exclusion at apply time regardless of lifecycle.

================================================================
Three sub-patches, atomic via MultiFilePatchTransaction
================================================================

Sub-1: `vllm/model_executor/layers/fla/ops/chunk.py`
   1A: import line — drop `input_guard` import
   1B: chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd signature — add ssm_state_indices, has_initial_state
   1C: chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd internal call to fwd_h — pass new kwargs
   1D: ChunkGatedDeltaRuleFunction.forward — major rewrite (drop @input_guard,
       manual contiguous, accelerator.device_index context)
   1E: chunk_gated_delta_rule (high-level API) signature + apply call

Sub-2: `vllm/model_executor/layers/fla/ops/chunk_delta_h.py`
   2A: kernel @triton.jit autotune key + constexpr param block
   2B: kernel main flow if-USE_INITIAL_STATE branch
   2C: kernel epilogue if-STORE_FINAL_STATE branch
   2D: Python wrapper chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd_h signature + body

Sub-3: `vllm/model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn_linear_attn.py`
   3A: GdnLinearAttnFlashInfer.forward_cuda signature + body
   3B: GdnLinearAttnNativeFla.forward_native signature + passthrough
   3C: _forward_core gather/scatter elimination (THE WIN SITE)

================================================================
Atomic apply via MultiFilePatchTransaction
================================================================

All three patchers in single transaction:
- Phase 1 (dry-run): all anchors verified across all 3 files
- Phase 2 (commit): apply each patcher in order
- Rollback on any failure: in-memory snapshots restore

Either ALL THREE files patched OR NONE. Operator never sees half-patched
state which would crash on first GDN forward call.

================================================================
Drift detection
================================================================

Patches auto-SKIP if upstream landed equivalent fix (drift markers):
  - "ssm_state_indices"        — added by PR #41824 OR FLA equivalent
  - "IS_CONTINUOUS_BATCHING"   — Triton kernel constexpr (kernel patch)
  - "HAS_INITIAL_STATE_MASK"   — Triton kernel constexpr (kernel patch)

Configured per-patcher. PN59 wiring already lists "ssm_state_indices" as
its drift marker (added 2026-05-06).

================================================================
Conflict gating
================================================================

PATCH_REGISTRY entry has:
  conflicts_with: ["PN59", "PN54"]

dispatcher.should_apply() will SKIP PN79 if either is enabled:
  - PN59: anchor on chunk_gated_delta_rule_fwd body — overlaps with 1B/1C
  - PN54: removes .contiguous() on the same gather line PN79 erases entirely

Operator must explicitly disable PN59/PN54 in YAML config to enable PN79.
27B PROD config recommended: PN59=0, PN79=1 (per empirical "PN59 dead code"
finding).

K.1.R anchor audit 2026-05-28 — STABLE PATCH critical findings
--------------------------------------------------------------
Per-sub-patch state against new pin nightly-626fa9bb (multi-arch digest
sha256:674922aae790c2cbf45f4e844098d227b80d40a74bfc7797a444d213a221879f,
upstream SHA 626fa9bba5663a5cf6a870debf031ee344ddb822):

  * Sub-1 (chunk.py): ✓ ALL 7 anchors PASS byte-equivalent.
    Target file ``model_executor/layers/fla/ops/chunk.py`` unchanged
    in the relevant surfaces.
  * Sub-2 (chunk_delta_h.py): ✓ ALL 7 anchors PASS byte-equivalent.
    Target file ``model_executor/layers/fla/ops/chunk_delta_h.py``
    unchanged in the relevant kernel surfaces.
  * Sub-3 (gdn_linear_attn.py): ⚠ FILE MOVED upstream.
    The monolithic ``model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn_linear_attn.py``
    was REFACTORED INTO model-specific files:
      ``model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn/__init__.py``
      ``model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn/base.py`` (common base class)
      ``model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn/kimi_gdn_linear_attn.py``
      ``model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn/olmo_gdn_linear_attn.py``
      ``model_executor/layers/mamba/gdn/qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py``
    The 3 anchors (3A FORWARD_CUDA, 3B FORWARD_NATIVE, 3C GATHER_SCATTER)
    no longer resolve — ``resolve_vllm_file`` returns None for the
    old path, ``apply()`` returns ``skipped``. Re-anchoring requires
    splitting Sub-3 into per-model sub-patches (one each for
    qwen_gdn_linear_attn.py + olmo_gdn_linear_attn.py + base.py).
    Deferred to ``ANCHOR_REFRESH_K1R.2``.
  * Sub-4 (olmo_hybrid.py): ⚠ 1 anchor DRIFT.
    ``ANCHOR_4A_OLMO_FORWARD_CORE_OLD`` substring
    `if attn_metadata.num_prefills > 0:` no longer matches in the
    new file — the gather/scatter elimination site shifted. Patch
    self-skips on the new pin (TextPatcher anchor-not-found warning,
    apply returns ``skipped``).

Status under new pin: PN79 still applies on Sub-1 + Sub-2 (the kernel
+ orchestrator paths) but NOT Sub-3 + Sub-4. The kernel-level wins
remain; the gather/scatter elimination at call sites is deferred
until the per-model file split is properly re-anchored.

STABLE patch contract preservation:
  * ``stable_kind="text-patch"`` semantics preserved.
  * ``anchor_manifest.json`` covers the file paths that exist on the
    PRIOR pin (dev371) — the manifest accurately reflects what the
    patch targeted at promotion time. Updating the manifest to point
    at the new file structure is a separate slice once Sub-3 is
    re-anchored against the per-model files.

This is the highest-priority follow-up out of K.1.R for the new pin
because PN79 is STABLE + production-validated; degrading 2 of 4 sub-
patches to silent skip is acceptable temporarily but should not become
the steady state. See ``K_1_R_R_ANCHOR_REFRESH_2026-05-28_RU.md`` for
the deferred re-anchor scope.
