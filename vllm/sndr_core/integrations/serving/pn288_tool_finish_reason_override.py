"""Wiring for PN288 — qwen3_coder tool_call finish_reason override
(§1.3 of the unified plan, Phase B / dry-run scaffold).

The decision logic lives in the companion middleware module
``vllm.sndr_core.middleware.pn288_finish_reason_override``. This file
is the text-patch overlay that wires that logic into
``OpenAIServingChat._create_chat_completion`` at two anchors:

  1. **Streaming** (serving.py:884-893 on pin 626fa9bb) — the if-block
     that assigns ``finish_reason_`` inside the choice-data loop.
  2. **Non-streaming** (serving.py:1306-1310) — the
     ``is_finish_reason_tool_calls`` bool assignment.

Anchor strategy
---------------
Verified live against the running ``vllm-gemma4-tq-mtp-structured-k4-k4``
container 2026-05-30 (pin 626fa9bb). Both anchors are stable across
the 0.21.1rc0 → 0.21.1rc1+g626fa9bba window — none of the merged PRs
between dev371 and 626fa9bb touched the finish_reason emission sites.

Both replacements are wrapped in ``try / except Exception`` so any
import or runtime failure in the middleware logic falls back to the
upstream verdict — observability must not break the request.

Gates
-----
  * ``GENESIS_ENABLE_PN288_TOOL_FINISH_REASON_OVERRIDE`` — install
    gate. Default OFF; no text patch is written unless this is ``1``.
  * ``GENESIS_PN288_DRY_RUN`` — Phase B vs Phase C selector, read
    inside the middleware module at decision time (NOT at patch time)
    so an operator can flip it on a live container without re-patching.
