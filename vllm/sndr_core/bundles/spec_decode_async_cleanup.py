"""Bundle: spec-decode async cleanup trio (community tier).

Atomic apply of P79b + P79c + P79d — the async-spec-decode cleanup
chain. These three patches address related race conditions in the
async-decode path; today they're 3 separate dispatcher entries but
share a common root cause and should fail/succeed together.

  P79b — Async proposer sync (gpu_model_runner.py).
  P79c — Stale spec-token cleanup on preempt (scheduler.py).
  P79d — Preempt async-discard (scheduler.py).

Cross-file (worker + scheduler) — atomic apply guarantees no boot
state where (e.g.) scheduler-side cleanup is active but worker-side
async sync isn't, which can manifest as stale spec tokens accepted
into the wrong request's KV slots.
