"""Phase 5 community SDK — manifest loader + path enumeration.

Thin wrapper over `registry_v2.load_patch_manifest()`. Adds:

  • `load_manifest(path)` — same shape but raises uniformly with a path
    prefix in the error so operator sees which manifest is broken.
  • `list_manifest_paths(root)` — walk a `plugins/community/` tree and
    return every `manifest.yaml`, skipping `_template` directories
    (per §6.6 no-stub gate — templates are draft examples, not registry
    entries).
