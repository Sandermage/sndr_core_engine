# Workload-Gate Routing Table

`sndr routing-table` emits a JSON contract that external callers
(aggregators, proxies, gateways) consume to dispatch incoming
requests to the correct vllm preset based on **workload class**,
**expected output length**, **concurrency mode**, and **model
family**.

Schema: [`vllm/sndr_core/cli/routing_schema.json`](../vllm/sndr_core/cli/routing_schema.json) (v1).

## What this is — and what it is NOT

| | This contract | NOT this contract |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | external request routers | the vllm engine |
| **Decision time** | per-request, at the aggregator | n/a — the engine sees K already chosen |
| **Output** | which preset to forward the request to | the actual `--speculative-config` value |
| **K switching** | TWO containers (K=1 default + K=4 structured); request goes to the right one | NOT runtime K switching inside a single engine |
| **Coverage** | only what's been bench-measured + cited evidence | NOT a generic K-policy speculator |

The genesis-vllm-patches repo is **authoritative** for the rules:
each entry cites a bench-source path in its `evidence` field.
Consumers **must not** mutate the rules.

## How to use

### 1. At consumer startup

```bash
python3 -m vllm.sndr_core.cli routing-table --json > /etc/genesis/routing.json
```

(Or, equivalently, run `python3 -m vllm.sndr_core.cli routing-table --json` as
a subprocess on aggregator startup and cache the result.)

### 2. Per request

```pseudocode
table = load_cached_table()
workload = classify(request, table.workload_class_detection)
length   = bucket_length(request, table.length_detection)
conc     = current_concurrency_mode(target_upstream)   # consumer-owned
family   = lookup_model_family(request.model, table.presets)

for rule in table.routing_rules:
    if rule.model_family == family and \
       matches(rule.when, workload=workload, length=length, conc=conc):
        return rule.preset_key

# No rule matched — use the default.
for preset in table.presets:
    if preset.model_family == family and preset.default_for_family:
        return preset.preset_key

# Unknown family — fall back to the model's natural preset
# (V1 model-config lookup, no K=4 override).
return None
```

### 3. Refresh policy

Schema v1 is **restart-only**. Consumers must NOT hot-reload the
table; operators restart the aggregator after a preset change.

## Versioning

`schema_version: 1` is frozen for the lifetime of this schema.
Consumers seeing an unknown version must **warn and degrade gracefully**
(fall back to single-preset routing), not crash. New cells are added
by extending the `routing_rules` list — never by bumping the version.

A future v2 schema would require a coordinated upgrade across the
emitter and every consumer; we'll cross that bridge if a non-additive
contract change is ever needed.

## What's in the table

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `presets[]` | One entry per builtin preset alias. Each entry exposes `(preset_key, model, model_family, spec_decode_K, max_num_seqs, role, intended_workloads, default_for_family)`. |
| `routing_rules[]` | Evaluated top-to-bottom; **first match wins**. Multi-conc rules precede single-stream rules to avoid ambiguous matches. Each rule cites an `evidence` source and an `evidence_tag` (`measured` for direct A/B; `inferred` for cross-workload reasoning). |
| `workload_class_detection` | Language-neutral detection spec. The aggregator implements these heuristics; the spec is shipped in the table so non-Python consumers can implement the same rules. Order: `tool_call` > `structured_json` > `summarization` > `code_gen` > `free_chat`. |
| `concurrency_mode_detection` | Defines `single_stream` (in-flight ≤ 1) vs `multi_conc` (in-flight ≥ 2). Tracking the counter is the **consumer's** responsibility. |
| `length_detection` | `max_tokens <= 256` ⇒ `short`. Caller hint `expected_length` (if supplied) wins over the `max_tokens` bucket. |
| `fallback` | What to do when no rule matches: use `default_for_family`. When the model family is unknown: skip K=4 overrides, use V1 lookup. **K=1 is the default everywhere.** |
| `coverage_gaps[]` | Known untested cells (e.g. 31B multi-conc structured). Consumers should surface these to operators rather than silently routing to fallback. |

## Current rules (as of 2026-05-23)

```
gemma4_moe_26b_a4b:
  multi_conc + (structured_json | tool_call) + short  → prod-gemma4-26b-a4b-multiconc   (B4 evidence)
  single_stream + (structured_json | tool_call) + short → prod-gemma4-26b-a4b-mtp-k4    (B2 evidence)
  default                                              → prod-gemma4-26b-a4b-default   (K=1)

gemma4_dense_31b:
  single_stream + (structured_json | tool_call)       → prod-gemma4-31b-tq-mtp-structured-k4   (B1.2 evidence + β'-A artifact)
  default                                              → prod-gemma4-31b-tq-default   (K=1)
```

Everything else is **K=1**, by policy.

## Operator recipe — verify before deploy

```bash
# 1. Sanity check the schema
python3 -m vllm.sndr_core.cli routing-table --validate

# 2. Inspect the rules + gaps
python3 -m vllm.sndr_core.cli routing-table --json | jq '.routing_rules, .coverage_gaps'

# 3. Pin the table at the deploy boundary
python3 -m vllm.sndr_core.cli routing-table --json --out /etc/genesis/routing.json

# 4. Restart the aggregator to pick up the new table
systemctl restart genesis-aggregator
```
