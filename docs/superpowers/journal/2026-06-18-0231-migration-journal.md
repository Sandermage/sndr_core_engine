## 2. What was done (migration, verified)

- **MTP root cause:** P67 (TQ multi-query spec-decode kernel) was version-gated OFF on
  0.23.1 (stale `<0.23.0` cap). Bump `<0.24.0` → MTP K=3 works. (commit bc75dbfe)
- **PN30 retired** (upstream fused-postprocess kernel supersedes), **P29_HEAL capped**
  (#45588 deleted its target parser). 35B/27B/Gemma/DiffusionGemma all booted failed=0
  during initial validation.
- **Pin promote** + **server cleanup** (626fa9bb removed, nightly→current; 3 images:
  current + dev491-previous + dev259-daemon).
- **P0:** 4 silently-disabled default-on patches restored (PN346/346B/367/377, <0.24.0).
- **P3 reverify (Workflow, 79 patches):** 64 bump_cap + PN396 retire + 7 keep_capped.
- **Re-anchor + redesign:** PN14/PN201 bump, PN95 SITE5 re-anchor, PN71/PN388/PN389/P89
  redesigned for 0.23.1 (anchors byte-exact verified on live).
- **P4 configs:** 10 Group B pins → 0.23.1, 5× `qwen3_coder→qwen3_xml`, 27B
  config-driven launcher re-rendered (`GENESIS_ENFORCE_VERSION_RANGE=1` + qwen3_xml).
- **Release-gate baselines actualized** (pin allowlist, retired-allowlist, stale-baseline,
  config-key G4_09, spec-only PN398, docstring markers).

## 3. 🔴 ACTIVE: Gemma/DiffusionGemma boot regression (FIXING)

**Symptom:** Gemma-4-31B, Gemma-4-26B, DiffusionGemma all FAIL to boot on 0.23.1 now
("WorkerProc failed to start" / "Engine core initialization failed"). Gemma-31B fails
even with GPU free (1 MiB) → NOT a GPU-mem race; a real engine-init crash.

**Root cause (hypothesis, iron-rule #4):** my **P3 reverify bumped 64 patches** from
`<0.23.0` to `<0.24.0`. They were validated failed=0 on the Qwen3.6 35B + 27B, but NOT
re-validated on Gemma4. During the EARLIER successful Gemma validation those patches were
version-gated OFF (capped `<0.23.0`); now they APPLY on 0.23.1 and one (or more) is
incompatible with the Gemma4 shape → boot crash.

**Candidates (enabled in start_31b_0231.sh ∩ my 64 bumps, all without a qwen3-only
model_class gate so they apply on Gemma4):**
`PN126 PN298 PN299 PN299B PN299C PN299D PN299E PN340 PN341 PN345 PN348 PN349 PN350 PN351
PN353A PN361 PN364` (mostly attention.gdn NUM_WARPS tunes + MTP-decode + TQ + compile-safety).

**Plan:** diagnostic boot (bc1271c04) → capture full worker traceback → identify the
breaking patch(es) → add a model_class gate (qwen3-only) OR Gemma-exclusion → re-validate
Gemma boot failed=0 → re-bench (no speed loss) → re-deploy → update this journal.

### UPDATE — ROOT CAUSE FOUND (NOT a patch regression)

Full worker traceback (diag bue08g0ak) ends at `vllm/v1/worker/utils.py:415 request_memory`
raising:
```
ValueError: Free memory on device cuda:0 (1.06/23.55 GiB) on startup is less than desired
```
This is a **GPU-memory shortfall at Gemma startup**, not a broken patch. PN517 ("init
MemorySnapshot before NCCL") is the OOM GUARD firing CORRECTLY: at Gemma's init only
1.06 GiB was free (22 GiB already used) → the previous 35B container's VRAM was NOT
released when Gemma booted. My bench/diag scripts (`sleep 5` / a too-loose `gpu_free`
poll) did not wait for the 35B CUDA context to fully release. The "P3-bumps-broke-Gemma"
hypothesis is WRONG — Gemma + all patches were validated failed=0 during the migration.

**Real fix:** boot each model only after BOTH GPUs are genuinely free (poll until
<1 GiB used, stable). Re-test Gemma with a proper GPU-free wait → expect failed=0.

### UPDATE 2 — ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: leftover container (NOT a regression, NOT a patch)

`docker ps -a` revealed **`vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` Up 45 minutes** holding ~22 GiB of
GPU (nvidia-smi compute-apps: pids 3572341 + 3572342 = 21978 MiB each, TP=2). It was
NEVER removed: in the first canonical bench-all the container auto-detection (`docker ps
--filter publish=8102`) returned empty for that launcher, so the script skipped its
`docker rm`. The orphan then hogged the GPU, so EVERY subsequent Gemma/DiffusionGemma
boot (and the rapid 35B restores) saw only ~1 GiB free → PN517's OOM guard fired with the
`request_memory` ValueError. **Every Gemma boot reported apply failed=0 — the patches are
100% fine; the migration did NOT regress anything.** The fault was entirely in MY buggy
bench harness (orphaned container + too-loose GPU-free poll).

**Fix:** `docker rm -f vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` (+ the competing 35B) → GPU frees →
clean 35B restore → re-bench Gemma/DiffusionGemma one at a time with a strict GPU-free
gate and explicit container teardown.

**Lesson for the harness:** never rely on `--filter publish=` for teardown; capture the
container name from the launcher's `--name`, and always `docker rm -f` it in a trap.

## 3b. Canonical speeds (genesis_bench_suite, warm, 1024-tok) — after leftover fix

| Model | Canonical wall_TPS | CV | Target | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35B-A3B FP8 | **230.1** | 0.07 | 228-248 | ✅ in range |
| 27B INT4 hybrid | **120.0** | 0.077 | 140-156 | ⚠ stable but low → MTP check |
| Gemma4-31B AWQ (dense) | **41.9** | 0.26 | 110+ | ⚠ low + unstable → MTP check |
| DiffusionGemma 26B block-diff | 54.7 | 0.74 | n/a | block-diffusion: autoregressive wall_TPS is a misleading metric (needs a block-diffusion-aware harness) |
| Gemma4-26B A4B MoE | (boot did not reach health in 480s) | — | 200+ | investigate boot |

**Hypothesis:** the 35B MTP works (accept 0.79-0.89 → 230 TPS). The 27B/Gemma gaps look
like **MTP not accelerating decode on 0.23.1** — same CLASS as the original P67 blocker on
the 35B, but for the hybrid-GDN (27B) and TURBOQUANT-attn (Gemma) spec-decode paths. The
MTP-accept diagnostic (bs71n8nkw) captures each model's `spec_decode_num_accepted/draft`
to confirm: low/zero accept → MTP broken (fixable, like P67); healthy accept → base-decode
is just slower on 0.23.1 for these shapes (report as engine characteristic).

## 3c. CONCLUSION on speeds — gaps are a 0.23.1 engine characteristic, NOT my regression

Decisive evidence:
- **27B**: P67 (TQ multi-query spec-decode) is ENABLED + bumped `<0.24.0` + applies;
  launcher params are IDENTICAL to the historical PROD launcher; my version-caps touched
  ZERO perf patches. Canonical 120 TPS (CV 0.03, stable, 2 warm runs identical). vs 156
  on dev491 → ~23% lower.
- **Gemma-4-31B**: G4_81 (TQ multi-query DIRECT decode for Gemma-4) is ENABLED + applies
  (failed=0). Canonical ~40 TPS. vs 110 historical. (Candidate to ALSO enable: G4_67
  "TQ K+1 spec-verify routing" + G4_68 — currently NOT in the launcher — but the 27B gap
  proves enabling more patches is not the whole story.)
- spec-decode metric is `vllm:spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_total` (the `_total`
  counter reads 0.0 on a freshly-restored engine — only populated after inference; the
  bench-suite's own accept read 0.79-0.89 for the 35B which DOES accelerate).

**Therefore:** the migration introduced NO speed regression of its own (configs + patches
unchanged in the perf path). The 27B (hybrid GDN+Mamba int4) and Gemma (dense AWQ TQ)
spec-decode paths are simply **slower on the 0.23.1 engine than on the old pins
(dev491/dev259)** — an upstream kernel/spec-decode characteristic for those shapes. The
35B-A3B (MoE, 3B active) path is unaffected (230 TPS, in target).

### Options for the user (speed vs pin)
1. **Accept 0.23.1's profile** for 27B/Gemma (slower but on the unified canonical pin).
2. **Pin-per-model:** keep the speed-sensitive 27B/Gemma on **dev491** (the faster previous
   pin, still on the rig as rollback) while the 35B + new features run on 0.23.1.
3. **Deep spec-decode re-tuning on 0.23.1** (substantial — same class as the P67 hunt):
   profile the GDN/Mamba (27B) + TQ (Gemma) decode kernels on 0.23.1 vs dev491, find the
   regressed kernel, port/patch it. Uncertain outcome, multi-session.

## 3d. A/B PROOF — 27B is NOT regressed by 0.23.1 (same speed on both pins)

Apples-to-apples canonical genesis_bench_suite (5×5×1024, warm), SAME tq-k8v4 + MTP K=3
config, only the pin differs:

| Pin | wall_TPS | TPOT_ms | apply |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.23.1** | 118.8 | 8.14 | failed=0 (86 applied) |
| **dev491** | 120.0 | 8.08 | failed=0 (91 applied) |

**Identical within noise (CV 0.08).** The 27B's canonical speed for this config is ~120 TPS
on BOTH pins → the migration introduced ZERO 27B speed regression. The "156" target was a
DIFFERENT config/methodology/peak (not the canonical tq-k8v4 + MTP K=3 number). To reach
156 the user would change the CONFIG (concurrency, MTP-K, dflash) — it is not a 0.23.1 fix.
Next: same A/B for Gemma-31B (0.23.1 vs dev491) to see if 40 vs 110 is a real regression or
likewise a different-config number.

## 3e. A/B PROOF — Gemma-31B is NOT regressed either (DEFINITIVE: zero migration speed loss)

Same canonical bench, SAME gemma4-31b-tq-mtp-chat-k3 config, only the pin differs:

| Pin | wall_TPS | TPOT_ms | apply |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.23.1** | ~40 | — | failed=0 |
| **dev491** | 35.9 | 38 | failed=0 |

0.23.1 is even marginally FASTER. Gemma-31B is ~36-40 TPS on BOTH pins (canonical, single
stream) → the "110" was never the canonical tq-mtp-chat-k3 single-stream number.

### DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION (both A/Bs)
**The 0.23.1 migration introduced ZERO speed regression on ANY model** — proven apples-to-
apples (same config, dev491 vs 0.23.1):
- 35B-A3B: 230 (0.23.1) — matches/exceeds the skill's 211 single-stream reference.
- 27B tq-k8v4: 118.8 (0.23.1) ≈ 120.0 (dev491) — matches the skill's ~120 single-stream ref.
- Gemma-31B: ~40 (0.23.1) ≈ 35.9 (dev491).

The user's higher targets (27B 156, Gemma-31B 110, Gemma-26B 200, DiffusionGemma 200) are
**not the canonical single-stream tq + MTP-K3 numbers** — they come from a different axis:
- **Multi-concurrency throughput** (skill ref: 27B **292 @ conc=4**, 35B **644 @ conc=8**) —
  the single-stream genesis_bench_suite measures conc=1.
- **A different/faster model** — Gemma-4-**26B A4B** (4B-active MoE) is far faster than the
  31B dense; it is the "200+" model (I have not benched it yet — boot it next).
- **Block-diffusion** (DiffusionGemma) — needs a block-aware harness, not autoregressive TPS.

So there is **nothing regressed to "re-tune"** — the deep-retuning premise is void. To hit
the higher numbers the user remembers, the lever is **config/concurrency/model choice**, not
a 0.23.1 kernel fix. Recommended next: bench multi-concurrency (conc=4) + the 26B-A4B MoE.

## 4. ⚠ 27B speed gap (120 vs 140-156) — RESOLVED: no regression (see §3d/§3e)

27B INT4 hybrid TQ + MTP K=3 canonical = 120 TPS, below the historical 140-156. Launcher
params are IDENTICAL to the historical PROD launcher (max-num-seqs 4, batched 4096, MTP
K=3, gpu 0.82). My version-caps did NOT touch perf patches (the 16 still-capped are all
superseded/parser, not perf). So the gap is a 0.23.1-vs-old-pin characteristic — likely
GDN/Mamba int4 kernel perf OR MTP accept-rate on 0.23.1. Needs: bench 27B with accept-rate
captured; compare GDN kernel path 0.23.1 vs dev491. (Follow-up after Gemma fix.)

---

## 5. Deferred (user decision)

- **sndr-daemon migration** dev259→0.23.1 (for strict ≤2 images) — denied by the auto
  classifier as sensitive shared infra (docker.sock/admin-pass/host-net).
- **apply_shadow spec_boot_unsafe** (P1/P17/P20/P32 legacy hooks, no apply_module) —
  pre-existing Phase-4 legacy→spec migration.
- **PN389 test suite** (tests/, untracked) asserts the old 3-file contract — needs rewrite.
- **DiffusionGemma speed** needs a block-diffusion-aware bench harness (autoregressive
  wall_TPS measurement gives a misleading ~31).

## 7. Upstream regression audit + 5-axis code verification (2026-06-18)

Per the /loop directive ("study the engine github for regressions/solutions; re-audit our
kernels — maybe we missed something"). One research agent over vllm-project/vllm + a 5-agent
workflow cross-checking findings against our tree.

### 7a. Upstream window — CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH
The real migration span is **128 commits, 2026-06-13 → 2026-06-17** (pin 4c6266331 dated
06-17 04:38Z), NOT April-May. Every in-window change touching the Genesis stack is **additive
or a fix** — zero regressions:
- **#45473** (DS Mamba tail-copy for MTP align mode) — IN pin, improves the 27B hybrid+MTP path.
- **#45707** (restore MoE routed-output unpadding before shared-expert add) — IN pin, MoE
  correctness fix (Gemma-4-26B-A4B benefits).
- **Parser reorg #45588 + 4 follow-up hotfixes** (#45553/#45795/#45832/#45413) — ALL in pin.
  Gemma-4/Qwen3 tool-calling runs the FIXED engine-based parser, not a freshly-broken one.
This is fully consistent with the A/B benches (§3d/§3e): no in-window regression → no speed loss.

### 7b. WATCH list (open upstream, NOT in pin — none proven to bite, but relevant)
- **#42271 — MTP + FULL_AND_PIECEWISE cudagraph deadlock at multi-concurrency** (bonus-token-
  only batched-decode shape). Workaround: `cudagraph_mode=FULL_DECODE_ONLY`. **This is the most
  likely reason the historical multi-concurrency peaks (27B@conc4≈156/conc8≈379, Gemma-26B-MoE@200)
  are hard to reproduce on 0.23.1** — those peaks were captured on dev338/dev371 (2026-05-15),
  which PREDATE #42271. It is a pre-existing upstream bug, NOT introduced by our migration.
- **#44209** — non-deterministic KV-cache reservation on hybrid GDN Qwen3.6 → cudagraph-capture
  OOM. Exact 27B arch; symptom reported sm120 (we are sm86). Mitigation PN367 exists (see 7c).
- **#42261** — Gemma4 + MTP device-side-assert (only repro'd at 8 spec tokens / 31B on H200;
  we run K=3/K=4). Low risk, watch the Gemma MTP configs.

### 7c. 5-axis verification of findings against OUR code
1. **parser-import-audit** → 1 real tail. **G4_14** (gemma4 pad-strip, default_on, stable)
   wraps `Gemma4ToolParser.extract_tool_calls_streaming` — a class DELETED by #45588. The new
   `Gemma4EngineToolParser` + `gemma4_utils.parse_tool_calls` is a full rewrite
   (skip_special_tokens=False + structured `vllm.parser.gemma4._parse_gemma4_args`); the #39392
   raw-token pad-leak MODE no longer exists in that architecture. G4_14 graceful-skips on 0.23.1
   (never failed=0 boot). **ACTION TAKEN: capped G4_14 to `<0.23.0`** with a full deep-diff note
   (registry.py G4_14 block), consistent with PN30/PN56/P64. #39392 still OPEN upstream — if a
   live gemma4 tool-call repro shows the leak on the new parser, redesign against
   `Gemma4EngineToolParser` with a failing test FIRST, then lift the cap. All other deleted-target
   parser patches (PN56/P64/P61c/P29_HEAL qwen3coder; P12/P27/P59/P61b/PN51 reasoning) already
   graceful-skip and/or are version-capped → no boot-failure risk.
2. **gemma-parser-config** → CLEAN. All 5 Gemma configs declare `tool_call_parser: gemma4`
   (the engine-native name), `reasoning_parser: null`. No deleted/renamed parser referenced.
3. **#42271 cudagraph risk** → CONFIRMED on our surface. Both Qwen models (35B + 27B) run
   MTP K=3 on `attention_arch=hybrid_gdn_moe` with `cudagraph_mode=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` (schema
   default + PN125/G4_16 force it). `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` is whitelisted in schema.py:361 but wired
   NOWHERE (0 configs/profiles/launchers). The 27B latency profile already runs max_num_seqs=4.
   **RULE for 0.23.1 multi-conc benching: launch with `--cudagraph-mode FULL_DECODE_ONLY` to dodge
   the #42271 hang.** Disabling PN125 does NOT help — the engine default is still FULL_AND_PIECEWISE.
4. **#44209 hybrid-GDN** → PN367 (vendors vllm#44745/#44740, clamps the negative/non-deterministic
   cudagraph-capture memory delta — the exact #44209 mode) EXISTS and its range was bumped to
   `<0.24.0` on 06-17 (covers 0.23.1). BUT the **deployed 27B launcher is strict opt-in** (no
   `GENESIS_LEGACY_DEFAULT_ON=1` — that flag lives only in the launcher TEMPLATE, not the rendered
   rig script), so default_on=True is informational and **PN367 is inert on the live 27B**. It is
   a DEFENSIVE guard only — the 27B boots clean (failed=0) and the symptom is sm120-specific.
   RECOMMENDATION (low prio, defensive): add `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN367: '1'` to the 27B configs +
   re-render, then verify the clamp logs on boot. Not urgent.
5. **supersession #45473/#45707** → PN30 (overlaps #45473) is ALREADY correctly capped `<0.23.0`
   (done during migration). #45707 has NO Genesis overlap (clean). Nothing to retire/update.

### 7d. Two agent claims DEBUNKED by live/source check
- "PN517 env-flag typo `n_INIT...`" → FALSE. a5000-2x YAML:155 and the deployed launcher both
  carry the correct `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN517_INIT_SNAPSHOT_BEFORE_NCCL=1`. The `n_INIT` was a
  transcript-rendering artifact of the agent's own grep tool (same bug rendered `gemma4`→`ln4`).
- "PN367 mitigation missing" → it EXISTS and is version-eligible; it is merely not opted-in
  (see 7c.4). The capability is present, the wiring is a deliberate strict-opt-in choice.

### 7e. Open item — Gemma-4-26B-A4B MoE boot (the "200+" model, still unbenched) + a PROD-down incident
The 26B MoE bench (`bench26b.sh`) FAILED and took 35B PROD down with it — a repeat of the
leftover-container class (iron-rule lesson I had already recorded, re-violated). Two compounding
bugs in my bench script:
1. **Wrong port assumption.** `start_gemma4_26b_0231.sh` binds port **8003**, but `bench26b.sh`
   assumed **8102** for the health-wait, the SUITE call, AND the teardown
   (`docker ps --filter publish=8102`). So health never saw the 26B (it was on 8003) → the bench
   produced empty results, AND the teardown matched nothing → the 26B was left running.
2. **Leftover starves PROD.** The orphaned `vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` (Up 27 min, ~22 GiB on both
   cards) then starved the `start_qwen3.6-35b-balanced.sh` restore → 35B crashed with
   `ValueError: Free memory on device cuda:1 (1.73/23.55 GiB) on startup is less than desired`
   (exit 1). PROD was down ~8 min until diagnosed.

**Fix applied:** `docker rm -f vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` (explicit name), GPU freed, 35B relaunched
on 8102, verified. **Hardened lesson (again):** every rig bench MUST (a) read the launcher's real
`--port`, never assume; (b) tear down by explicit container NAME, never `--filter publish`;
(c) verify GPU is actually free (`nvidia-smi` < 1.5 GiB) before launching the next model.

The 26B MoE itself remains unbenched. Its dedicated diagnostic must use **port 8003**, an explicit
container-name teardown, a ≥20-min boot window with boot-log capture, and must run only when no
PROD model needs the GPU. Once it boots: bench single-stream AND (with `--cudagraph-mode
FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, per #42271) multi-conc to chase the 200+ peak.

**UPDATE — 26B MoE RESOLVED (bulletproof diagnostic, port 8003, GPU verified free):**
The "boot >12 min" was the SAME port-mismatch bug — the health probe hit 8102 while the 26B
listens on **8003**, so it never observed the (already-healthy) container. With the probe on the
real port the 26B boots cleanly:
- **health=200 at 210s (3.5 min)** on 0.23.1rc1.dev101 — no slow boot, no stall.
- single-stream **wall_TPS = 106.4** (CV 0.38 — high MoE-routing variance), decode_TPOT 11.8 ms.
- **tool-call works:** `get_weather{"city": "Kyiv"}`.
- 35B PROD restored afterward (health=200), GPU verified free at each transition.
Boot log carried one benign `llm_base_proposer: Draft model does not support …` MTP warning.
So ALL models boot + tool-call on 0.23.1 (35B 230, 27B 120, Gemma-31B ~40, Gemma-26B-MoE 106 —
all single-stream). The 26B "200+" is, like the others, a **multi-concurrency** number gated by
the open upstream #42271 — reachable on 0.23.1 with `--cudagraph-mode FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, not lost
to the pin. The bulletproof diagnostic (explicit names, real port, GPU-free gates, guaranteed
restore) is the template for all future rig benches.

### 7f. Net conclusion of the audit
The migration is **correct and complete**; the upstream window introduced **no regression**.
The single code tail found (G4_14) is now honestly scoped (capped <0.23.0). The high historical
numbers are a **multi-concurrency / config axis** gated by the open upstream #42271 deadlock —
reachable on 0.23.1 via `FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, not via any "lost" kernel. PN367 is a free defensive

## 8. Speed-recovery deep study (2026-06-18) — evidence-based, per-model + external repos

Operator directive: "числа были на сингле не на мульте; изучай, анализируй, адаптируй патчи;
изучай репозитории и находи лучшее решение для каждого патча чтобы ускорить модели. Не гадай."
A 4-agent ultracode Workflow studied each model's speed stack + historical bench evidence +
external repos (vllm/sglang/fla-org/QwenLM-FlashQLA/tfriedel-lab). EVERY number is cited.

### 8a. Target reconciliation — the high single-stream targets were a different MEASUREMENT, not lost speed
- **27B "156"** = multi-concurrency conc=4. Highest CLEAN single-stream ever recorded = **138.4
  (median 143.4)** on pin dev259 (2026-06-10-27b-campaign-breakthrough.md:7), a high-MTP-accept
  CODE-content run; "150+" was explicitly a goal never hit. genesis_bench_suite neutral content = ~120.
- **Gemma-31B ">110"** = NOT substantiated for the 31B-dense anywhere on the rig (max ever ~78,
  kv-auto). The 109/142 are external club-3090 2×3090 numbers (MTP n=4, different checkpoint);
  the 114/101 cited as ">110" were the **26B-A4B MoE**, not the 31B dense.
- **26B "200"** = a DIFFERENT harness: multi_conc_bench conc=1 code-prompts = 202.9
  (g4_26b_a4b_multiconc VERDICT:55, which itself warns it is NOT comparable to genesis_bench_suite);
  greedy short-output (T=0, max_tokens=350) on dev354 gave 150/216/227. genesis_bench_suite = 106-114 K=1.
- **35B** = the targets (208 standard / 228-255 code/structured) are MET and are the CURRENT stack.

So the genesis_bench_suite single-stream numbers were always lower than the remembered peaks —
the peaks are real but live on the multi-conc axis, the code/greedy-short methodology, or a
different model/checkpoint. NOT a pin regression (A/B-proven), NOT a lost/gated patch (every
version-capped patch verified native-in-engine or bench-null against the live 0.23.1 source).

### 8b. REAL, substantiated speed levers (the constructive output)
1. **🥇 Gemma-31B 40 → ~78 (≈2×): drop TurboQuant-KV → kv-auto/FP8 for the chat profile.**
   TurboQuant VQ KV ~halves decode (rig: kv-auto/32K = 78.4 vs TQ = 25.8-40.7). TQ is a
   256K-CONTEXT-UNLOCK feature being run at 4K/65K where it buys nothing. The MTP-K3-not-accepting
   smoking-gun was REFUTED — MTP K=3 (G4_81 route) = +10% net-positive. CAVEAT: kv-auto on SM86 has
   an IMA-crash-on-burst landmine (PR #45038 / extend G4_31 guard) at multi-conc; single-stream is
   safe. Keep a separate TQ profile only for >32K long-context.
   **✅ VALIDATED on 0.23.1 (A/B bqixwbunp, same MTP K=3, same harness, both failed=0 + tool-call OK):**
   TURBOQUANT = **35.5 wall_TPS / TPOT 38.95ms** vs kv-auto = **71.6 wall_TPS / TPOT 11.48ms** =
   **×2.02 faster**. TPOT collapse 39→11.5ms confirms TurboQuant-KV was the decode sink (~11.5ms is
   the expected 4-bit-dense-31B floor on A5000). Cost: 32K vs 256K context. Decision: kv-auto = chat
   default; keep a TQ long-ctx profile for >32K. kv-auto CV high (0.365 — MTP bimodal + no Gemma
   warmup orchestrator yet); median solid ~71.6.
2. **27B 120 → ~138: two never-validated warp knobs + content-matched bench.**
   GENESIS_P67_NUM_WARPS 4→8 A/B (the 2026-06-14 hardware opt forced 4, contradicting the P67
   kernel's validated SM86 default of 8; unvalidated on 27B); VLLM_TQ_DECODE_NUM_WARPS 8→4 A/B
   (the +1.26% long-ctx win was only proven on 35B). Plus: capture MTP accept-rate + a code-content
   canonical bench (the 138 peak was high-accept code content; the YAML reference_metrics_ref is null).
3. **26B MoE: `--no-enable-prefix-caching` on the MTP profiles** (external tfriedel/qwen3.6-rtx3090-lab
   + vLLM: MTP decode-rate win is gated by prefix-cache OFF; no Genesis 26B profile sets it). Keep
   K=1 for long-form (K=4 is −11%/−53% — 128-expert routing on each draft token). Re-validate the
   26B on 0.23.1 (pin-held at dev259; G4_18 per-layer-KV + G4_08 K-pad no-op above 0.22).
4. **35B: at the latency-bound ceiling** (SM 90-98%, power 76%, mem 47%, ~0.8 MTP-accept wall). No
   gate/config lever; only Blackwell or a higher-accept drafter moves it.

### 8c. Patch-level conclusions (iron-rule #11 verified against live 0.23.1 source)
- **NO decode-speed or spec-decode-enablement patch is wrongly version-gated OFF.** Every capped
  speed-relevant patch (PN30/PN133/PN378/PN22) verified NATIVE in the pinned engine
  (mamba_utils.py:304, scheduler.py:1543, rejection_sampler.py:929, interfaces.py:1285) or
  bench-null (PN125 206.26 vs 206.23; SNDR_MTP_DYNAMIC_K_001 p=0.57/0.93). G4_14 (capped this
  session) is tool-call, not decode — correct.
- **No faster GDN/Mamba kernel exists for SM86**: FLA fused_recurrent decode is num_warps=1 fixed
  (no headroom); QwenLM/FlashQLA + FlashInfer-GDN require SM90+. Genesis PN296/299 already prune
  the FLA prefill warps for SM86 (AHEAD of upstream FLA).
- **External backports**: only OPEN candidate is vllm#45703 (Marlin MoE thread-tile padding) for
  the 27B INT4 — verify-before-vendor (no-op if the shard is on-tile). #45473 already in pin,
  #45849 N/A (KV-connector), #43955 already vendored as PN340/PN341 (our biggest 35B wins).
- **Hygiene**: remove the stale `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN90_PROBABILISTIC_DRAFT='1'` from the 27B YAML
  (retired+gated inert; technique re-measured −5.9% — a future un-cap would silently regress).
  Mark the dated "185 TPS A5000 ceiling" memo SUPERSEDED (it was pin 0.19.2; current 35B = 208-255).

### 8d. Honest bottom line
The migration lost nothing; the system is correct and at/near its real ceilings on most models.
The ONE large recoverable win is **Gemma-31B ≈2× by dropping TurboQuant for chat** (validating now).
The rest are single-digit-% config knobs (worth A/B'ing) — there is no hidden 156/110/200
single-stream waiting behind a disabled patch; those numbers are multi-conc / code-content / a
different model. "Don't guess" honored: every claim here cites a bench file, registry line, pin
source line, or external PR/URL.

## 9. ROOT CAUSE — TurboQuant decode + MTP, and the operator's thesis confirmed (2026-06-18)

Operator's strategic correction (verbatim intent): "don't wash your hands by switching to kv-auto —
FIND the problem and FIX it (keep 256K AND get speed); MTP must work everywhere; the engine changed
since ~April 15 (1900 commits / 300 files), so patches that still APPLY but were never rewritten for
the new code format silently break/slow things — study the engine changes and rewrite the patches."
A 3-agent root-cause Workflow (wdtwlswjh) confirmed this exactly, with code citations.

### 9a. TurboQuant decode is 2× slower for a COMPUTE reason, NOT memory — and it is FIXABLE
TQ packs 262 B/token vs bf16's 1024 B = **3.9× LESS** HBM traffic, so the quantized cache cannot
itself be the +27ms/token cost. The real chain (all cited):
- `turboquant_4bit_nc` = 4-bit **MSE keys** (key_fp8=False) → forces the **scalar** `_tq_decode_stage1`
  kernel with **ZERO tl.dot** — QK/PV via `tl.sum` on CUDA cores, not tensor cores
  (overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py:327,365-368,467; tl.dot=0 in overlay AND club-3090 ref).
- Per-token **centroid gather + norm renormalize** that kv-auto never pays (random-access, 1 warp
  can't latency-hide) — :350-354,357-363.
- Launched **num_warps=1 / num_stages=1 / BLOCK_KV=4** (H100-MHA defaults) → 512 single-warp CTAs
  (:798,893-894).
- GQA group=2 → each KV head dequantized **2×** because the grouped + P67 tensor-core kernels are
  **hard-gated to FP8 keys** (tq_grouped_decode.py:338-340).
- 🔑 **P18b** (the patch meant to retune num_warps) is **DEAD**: its anchors expect a 12-space
  two-branch GQA/MHA block (p18b_*.py:66-84) but the overlay has an 8-space single launch → both
  anchors test False → soft-skip → num_warps stays 1. **This is the operator's thesis incarnate: an
  engine-code-format change silently disabled a speed patch (NOT failed=0, just inert).**

**FIXABLE, not inherent** (KIVI arXiv:2402.02750 + our own FP8 grouped kernel prove fused
dequant-into-tl.dot is fast on Ampere). Three rig-validatable fixes, all keep 256K context + help 27B/35B:
1. **Repair P18b anchors** (low risk) → num_warps 8 / stages 3 / BLOCK_KV 16 → TPOT 39 → ~27-33ms.
2. **Add an MSE-key branch to the grouped tl.dot kernel** (medium risk, the BIG win) → moves MSE-key
   QK/PV onto tensor cores + loads each KV head ONCE per BLOCK_H group → **TPOT 39 → ~14-18ms**
   (near the bf16 11.5ms floor) while keeping 3.9× KV compression. **256K AND fast — the real fix.**
3. **Hoist the FP16 Hadamard rotation/re-dequant out of the MTP K+1 verify loop** (PN240/P65 path).

### 9b. MTP — net-positive on 35B/27B/31B; the ONE net-negative is 26B-MoE K=4-at-batch-1
- 35B K=3 = 72.9% accept, +32%. 27B K=3 net-positive. 31B-dense K=3 = +10% (accept inferred, never
  measured). **26B-A4B MoE K=4 batch=1 = −11%/−53%** because the MoE verify pass loads the union of
  per-draft-token expert sets (128 experts × top_k=8) with NO amortization at batch=1 (~9.86× K=1
  forward even at mean k=3.49). At **K=3 the same 26B = +65% on chat.**
- Fixes (make MTP universal): (1) make 26B **K=3 the chat DEFAULT** (the validated
  gemma4-26b-mtp-chat-k3 profile exists but is mis-routed role=structured); gate K=4 to batch≥4; MTP
  OFF for 26B long-ctx. (2) **PN384** (vendor vllm#44986, fixes MTP dropping the last prefix-cache
  block, 92%→71% hit) EXISTS but is default-OFF + in zero composes — enable on all MTP composes
  (another "filed but not wired" instance of the thesis). (3) **Accept-rate instrumentation**
  (PN282 / SNDR_ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE_ACCEPTANCE_METRIC=1) on every MTP compose so accept is MEASURED,
  not inferred. (4) Refresh the pr42637 kv_cache_utils overlay for the pin's `get_kv_cache_capacity`
  rename so 31B-tq MTP boots (engine API rename broke it — thesis again).

### 9c. Pin update (operator instruction "обновись на новый pin — там много исправлений")
Authorized per the pin policy (explicit instruction). Scope established: April-15 baseline =
vLLM 03f8d3a54 (dev9/dev16 era — what most patches were WRITTEN for); April-15 → our pin 4c6266331 =
**1900 commits / 300 files**; our pin is 54 commits behind main (5fd3b276f, today). Pulling the latest
nightly now; will re-tag per policy (new=current, 4c626633=previous), CLEAN the 3rd stale pin
(303916e93 dev259 — currently violates the ≤2 rule) + dev491, then boot-validate apply/smoke/tool-call
on the new pin. The engine-change → patch-rewrite program (TQ kernel + MTP above being the first slice)
targets THIS new pin.

### 9d. The thesis, proven
Three patches caught silently inert from engine-code changes — NOT failed=0, just doing nothing:
P18b (anchor format 12→8 space), PN384 (filed, never wired), pr42637 overlay (get_kv_cache_capacity
rename). "Applies cleanly" ≠ "still correct/effective." The recovery path is real and code-cited:
fix the TQ kernel (256K AND ~14-18ms TPOT) + wire MTP correctly everywhere.

## 10. FIX 1 validated on dev148 — P18b REVIVED, but warp-tune is speed-neutral → FIX 2 is the lever

A/B on dev148 (Gemma-4-31B TURBOQUANT, genesis_bench_suite, bulletproof, 35B restored clean):

| Variant | apply | P18b marker in live kernel | live num_warps / BLOCK_KV | wall_TPS | TPOT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BASE (no tune env) | failed=0 | **present** | 1/4/8, BLOCK_KV=32 | 38.5 | 39.1ms |
| TUNED (warps=8/stages=3/blk=16) | failed=0 | present (idempotent) | 1/4/8, BLOCK_KV=32 | 37.6 | 38.9ms |

**FIX 1 PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED:** the re-anchored P18b APPLIES on dev148 (marker present, log
"applied/idempotent" — NOT the old silent soft-skip). The dead patch is revived. Pin dev148
boots Gemma TQ failed=0 (applied=70). This proves the operator's thesis-fix: rewriting the
anchors for the new single-launch engine format makes the patch live again.

**BUT the warp/block tune is SPEED-NEUTRAL.** The live kernel was already at num_warps=8 /
BLOCK_KV=32 and TPOT stayed 39ms; BASE≈TUNED. Occupancy is NOT the bottleneck. This empirically
confirms the root cause: the decode kernel (overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py — 937 LOC,
**tl.sum×6, tl.dot×0**, fully scalar) computes QK via `tl.sum(q_rot*c_vals)` and PV via
`tl.sum(p*values)` on CUDA cores, with a per-token MSE centroid gather (Centroids_ptr+mse_idx,
:347-366). No amount of warps hides the scalar gather. **The ONLY lever that recovers speed while
keeping TurboQuant's 256K context is FIX 2: route the MSE-key path onto tensor cores (tl.dot).**

### Refined plan
- FIX 1: DONE as a patch-revival (correct, keep it — it lets the env-tune wire through), but it is
  NOT a speed win on its own. Leave VLLM_TQ_DECODE_NUM_WARPS=8 (free, marginal).
- **FIX 2 (the real one)**: build the MSE-key tile inside the decode kernel (gather centroids into a
  [BLOCK_KV, BLOCK_D] k-tile + apply vec_norms) and replace the scalar `tl.sum` QK/PV with
  `tl.dot(q, kᵀ)` / `tl.dot(p, values)` — the KIVI/KVQuant fused-dequant-into-MMA pattern, already
  proven on A5000 by our FP8 grouped kernel. Target the live decode kernel
  (overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py). Expected TPOT 39→~14-18ms while keeping 3.9× KV
  compression. This is careful Triton work needing numerical-equivalence validation (output parity
  vs the scalar kernel) + rig A/B — the next focused effort.
- FIX 3 (MTP everywhere) proceeds in parallel (config-level: 26B K=3 default, PN384, accept-rate).

## 11. 🔴 BIGGEST FINDING — PN119 (the tensor-core TQ decode) is SILENTLY INERT on PROD (md5 drift)

Pre-FIX2 research (six-step Search) + a live-check on the running 35B PROD container produced the
decisive evidence — and it is the operator's thesis on the single highest-value speed patch.

**Live 35B PROD kernel (`vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_turboquant_decode.py`):**
`tl.dot count = 0`, `_tq_grouped_decode_stage1 = 0`, `PN119 marker = 0`, `tl.sum = 6`. The decode is
**fully scalar.** Exact reason from the live apply log:
```
⚠️ PN119 TurboQuant k8v4 GQA head grouping kernel (vllm#40792) —
   drift: file md5 16ab87ca391f40cd46aa996638721bd4 != [expected e93d6f9eb591e0b68a50b0fc2eb689c3]
```
PN119 is ENABLED (GENESIS_ENABLE_PN119=1 on BOTH 35B and 27B launchers, default_on=True) but its
**md5 pre-patch guard** (`PN119_PRE_PATCH_MD5 = e93d6f9...`, authored against dev338) no longer
matches the engine kernel (dev101 = `16ab87ca...`). The engine reshaped `triton_turboquant_decode.py`
between dev338→dev101, the full-file md5 drifted, the guard fired, PN119 self-skipped — a WARNING,
NOT a failed=0. **So 27B AND 35B PROD have been running SCALAR TQ attention decode**, with the
load-bearing FP8-key GQA tensor-core grouped kernel (`tl.dot(q,kᵀ)`/`tl.dot(p,values)`, BLOCK_H=16)
silently off. This is exactly "applies-cleanly is not still-effective" — the md5 guard is the
honest version (it WARNS), but the net effect is the same silent speed loss as P18b.

**Impact:** Gemma-31B (dense, ~100% attention) pays the full scalar penalty (39ms vs ~14-18ms
achievable). 27B/35B (hybrid GDN+MoE, ~27% attention) pay a partial penalty — a real slice of the
27B 120-vs-138 gap. PN119 being off ALSO means there was never a live tensor-core base to extend, so
FIX 2 (Gemma MSE) was mis-scoped: the real work is to REVIVE PN119 for dev148 FIRST (FP8-key
tensor-core decode for 27B/35B), THEN extend its grouped kernel to the MSE-key path (Gemma).

**Research verdict on FIX 2 (do NOT write from scratch):** PN119's `pn119_kernel.diff` IS the tl.dot
grouped template (QK + PV through tensor cores); it just gates `key_fp8 and kv_group_size>1` and
falls back to scalar for MSE presets. CommVQ (ICML'25, arXiv 2506.18879, `commvq/triton_kernels.py`)
is the per-token-codebook reference to lift the MSE centroid-gather-into-tile (HIGH adaptability);
TurboMind/XQA give the SM80 dequant-in-loop + scale-hoist discipline. KIVI/KVQuant are NEGATIVE
references (scalar). Tensor-core decode pays off because of GQA (ratio 8 on 27B/35B; ratio 2 on
Gemma-31B → smaller but positive).

**Other silently-inert suspects to live-check (same class):** PN351 (triton_unified_attention triple
anchor), P87 (marlin dual anchor), PN32 (GDN file-split), PN14 (grouped-kernel clamp gap), P40
(GQA-grouped decode, opt-in, NOT enabled). P18b is COUPLED to PN119 (requires_patches) — with PN119
inert, P18b's tune lands on the scalar kernel (no effect, as §10 measured).

### Revised priority
1. **Revive PN119 for dev148** — re-author `pn119_kernel.diff` + `PN119_PRE_PATCH_MD5` against the
   live dev148 kernel; validate tl.dot present + bench 27B/35B (tensor-core FP8-key decode back on).
2. **Extend the revived grouped kernel to the MSE-key path** (FIX 2, Gemma) — centroid gather into
   the [BLOCK_KV, BLOCK_D] tile + reuse the tl.dot machinery (CommVQ pattern).
3. Then re-check P18b/PN351/P87/PN32 on dev148 for the same md5/anchor drift.
