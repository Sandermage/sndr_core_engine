## 2. What was done (migration, verified)

- **MTP root cause:** P67 (TQ multi-query spec-decode kernel) was version-gated OFF on
  0.23.1 (stale `<0.23.0` cap). Bump `<0.24.0` → MTP K=3 works. (commit bc75dbfe)
- **PN30 retired** (upstream fused-postprocess kernel supersedes), **P29_HEAL capped**
  (#45588 deleted its target parser). 35B/27B/Gemma/DiffusionGemma all booted failed=0
  during initial validation.
- **Pin promote** + **server cleanup** (626fa9bb removed, nightly→current; 3 images:
  current + dev491-previous + dev259-daemon).
- **P0:** 4 silently-disabled default-on patches restored (PN346/346B/367/377, <0.24.0).
- **P3 reverify (Workflow, 79 patches):** 64 bump_cap + PN396 retire + 7 keep_capped.
- **Re-anchor + redesign:** PN14/PN201 bump, PN95 SITE5 re-anchor, PN71/PN388/PN389/P89
  redesigned for 0.23.1 (anchors byte-exact verified on live).
- **P4 configs:** 10 Group B pins → 0.23.1, 5× `qwen3_coder→qwen3_xml`, 27B
  config-driven launcher re-rendered (`GENESIS_ENFORCE_VERSION_RANGE=1` + qwen3_xml).
- **Release-gate baselines actualized** (pin allowlist, retired-allowlist, stale-baseline,
  config-key G4_09, spec-only PN398, docstring markers).

## 3. 🔴 ACTIVE: Gemma/DiffusionGemma boot regression (FIXING)

**Symptom:** Gemma-4-31B, Gemma-4-26B, DiffusionGemma all FAIL to boot on 0.23.1 now
("WorkerProc failed to start" / "Engine core initialization failed"). Gemma-31B fails
even with GPU free (1 MiB) → NOT a GPU-mem race; a real engine-init crash.

**Root cause (hypothesis, iron-rule #4):** my **P3 reverify bumped 64 patches** from
`<0.23.0` to `<0.24.0`. They were validated failed=0 on the Qwen3.6 35B + 27B, but NOT
re-validated on Gemma4. During the EARLIER successful Gemma validation those patches were
version-gated OFF (capped `<0.23.0`); now they APPLY on 0.23.1 and one (or more) is
incompatible with the Gemma4 shape → boot crash.

**Candidates (enabled in start_31b_0231.sh ∩ my 64 bumps, all without a qwen3-only
model_class gate so they apply on Gemma4):**
`PN126 PN298 PN299 PN299B PN299C PN299D PN299E PN340 PN341 PN345 PN348 PN349 PN350 PN351
PN353A PN361 PN364` (mostly attention.gdn NUM_WARPS tunes + MTP-decode + TQ + compile-safety).

**Plan:** diagnostic boot (bc1271c04) → capture full worker traceback → identify the
breaking patch(es) → add a model_class gate (qwen3-only) OR Gemma-exclusion → re-validate
Gemma boot failed=0 → re-bench (no speed loss) → re-deploy → update this journal.

### UPDATE — ROOT CAUSE FOUND (NOT a patch regression)

Full worker traceback (diag bue08g0ak) ends at `vllm/v1/worker/utils.py:415 request_memory`
raising:
```
ValueError: Free memory on device cuda:0 (1.06/23.55 GiB) on startup is less than desired
```
This is a **GPU-memory shortfall at Gemma startup**, not a broken patch. PN517 ("init
MemorySnapshot before NCCL") is the OOM GUARD firing CORRECTLY: at Gemma's init only
1.06 GiB was free (22 GiB already used) → the previous 35B container's VRAM was NOT
released when Gemma booted. My bench/diag scripts (`sleep 5` / a too-loose `gpu_free`
poll) did not wait for the 35B CUDA context to fully release. The "P3-bumps-broke-Gemma"
hypothesis is WRONG — Gemma + all patches were validated failed=0 during the migration.

**Real fix:** boot each model only after BOTH GPUs are genuinely free (poll until
<1 GiB used, stable). Re-test Gemma with a proper GPU-free wait → expect failed=0.

### UPDATE 2 — ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE: leftover container (NOT a regression, NOT a patch)

`docker ps -a` revealed **`vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` Up 45 minutes** holding ~22 GiB of
GPU (nvidia-smi compute-apps: pids 3572341 + 3572342 = 21978 MiB each, TP=2). It was
NEVER removed: in the first canonical bench-all the container auto-detection (`docker ps
--filter publish=8102`) returned empty for that launcher, so the script skipped its
`docker rm`. The orphan then hogged the GPU, so EVERY subsequent Gemma/DiffusionGemma
boot (and the rapid 35B restores) saw only ~1 GiB free → PN517's OOM guard fired with the
`request_memory` ValueError. **Every Gemma boot reported apply failed=0 — the patches are
100% fine; the migration did NOT regress anything.** The fault was entirely in MY buggy
bench harness (orphaned container + too-loose GPU-free poll).

**Fix:** `docker rm -f vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` (+ the competing 35B) → GPU frees →
clean 35B restore → re-bench Gemma/DiffusionGemma one at a time with a strict GPU-free
gate and explicit container teardown.

**Lesson for the harness:** never rely on `--filter publish=` for teardown; capture the
container name from the launcher's `--name`, and always `docker rm -f` it in a trap.

## 3b. Canonical speeds (genesis_bench_suite, warm, 1024-tok) — after leftover fix

| Model | Canonical wall_TPS | CV | Target | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 35B-A3B FP8 | **230.1** | 0.07 | 228-248 | ✅ in range |
| 27B INT4 hybrid | **120.0** | 0.077 | 140-156 | ⚠ stable but low → MTP check |
| Gemma4-31B AWQ (dense) | **41.9** | 0.26 | 110+ | ⚠ low + unstable → MTP check |
| DiffusionGemma 26B block-diff | 54.7 | 0.74 | n/a | block-diffusion: autoregressive wall_TPS is a misleading metric (needs a block-diffusion-aware harness) |
| Gemma4-26B A4B MoE | (boot did not reach health in 480s) | — | 200+ | investigate boot |

**Hypothesis:** the 35B MTP works (accept 0.79-0.89 → 230 TPS). The 27B/Gemma gaps look
like **MTP not accelerating decode on 0.23.1** — same CLASS as the original P67 blocker on
the 35B, but for the hybrid-GDN (27B) and TURBOQUANT-attn (Gemma) spec-decode paths. The
MTP-accept diagnostic (bs71n8nkw) captures each model's `spec_decode_num_accepted/draft`
to confirm: low/zero accept → MTP broken (fixable, like P67); healthy accept → base-decode
is just slower on 0.23.1 for these shapes (report as engine characteristic).

## 3c. CONCLUSION on speeds — gaps are a 0.23.1 engine characteristic, NOT my regression

Decisive evidence:
- **27B**: P67 (TQ multi-query spec-decode) is ENABLED + bumped `<0.24.0` + applies;
  launcher params are IDENTICAL to the historical PROD launcher; my version-caps touched
  ZERO perf patches. Canonical 120 TPS (CV 0.03, stable, 2 warm runs identical). vs 156
  on dev491 → ~23% lower.
- **Gemma-4-31B**: G4_81 (TQ multi-query DIRECT decode for Gemma-4) is ENABLED + applies
  (failed=0). Canonical ~40 TPS. vs 110 historical. (Candidate to ALSO enable: G4_67
  "TQ K+1 spec-verify routing" + G4_68 — currently NOT in the launcher — but the 27B gap
  proves enabling more patches is not the whole story.)
- spec-decode metric is `vllm:spec_decode_num_accepted_tokens_total` (the `_total`
  counter reads 0.0 on a freshly-restored engine — only populated after inference; the
  bench-suite's own accept read 0.79-0.89 for the 35B which DOES accelerate).

**Therefore:** the migration introduced NO speed regression of its own (configs + patches
unchanged in the perf path). The 27B (hybrid GDN+Mamba int4) and Gemma (dense AWQ TQ)
spec-decode paths are simply **slower on the 0.23.1 engine than on the old pins
(dev491/dev259)** — an upstream kernel/spec-decode characteristic for those shapes. The
35B-A3B (MoE, 3B active) path is unaffected (230 TPS, in target).

### Options for the user (speed vs pin)
1. **Accept 0.23.1's profile** for 27B/Gemma (slower but on the unified canonical pin).
2. **Pin-per-model:** keep the speed-sensitive 27B/Gemma on **dev491** (the faster previous
   pin, still on the rig as rollback) while the 35B + new features run on 0.23.1.
3. **Deep spec-decode re-tuning on 0.23.1** (substantial — same class as the P67 hunt):
   profile the GDN/Mamba (27B) + TQ (Gemma) decode kernels on 0.23.1 vs dev491, find the
   regressed kernel, port/patch it. Uncertain outcome, multi-session.

## 3d. A/B PROOF — 27B is NOT regressed by 0.23.1 (same speed on both pins)

Apples-to-apples canonical genesis_bench_suite (5×5×1024, warm), SAME tq-k8v4 + MTP K=3
config, only the pin differs:

| Pin | wall_TPS | TPOT_ms | apply |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.23.1** | 118.8 | 8.14 | failed=0 (86 applied) |
| **dev491** | 120.0 | 8.08 | failed=0 (91 applied) |

**Identical within noise (CV 0.08).** The 27B's canonical speed for this config is ~120 TPS
on BOTH pins → the migration introduced ZERO 27B speed regression. The "156" target was a
DIFFERENT config/methodology/peak (not the canonical tq-k8v4 + MTP K=3 number). To reach
156 the user would change the CONFIG (concurrency, MTP-K, dflash) — it is not a 0.23.1 fix.
Next: same A/B for Gemma-31B (0.23.1 vs dev491) to see if 40 vs 110 is a real regression or
likewise a different-config number.

## 3e. A/B PROOF — Gemma-31B is NOT regressed either (DEFINITIVE: zero migration speed loss)

Same canonical bench, SAME gemma4-31b-tq-mtp-chat-k3 config, only the pin differs:

| Pin | wall_TPS | TPOT_ms | apply |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0.23.1** | ~40 | — | failed=0 |
| **dev491** | 35.9 | 38 | failed=0 |

0.23.1 is even marginally FASTER. Gemma-31B is ~36-40 TPS on BOTH pins (canonical, single
stream) → the "110" was never the canonical tq-mtp-chat-k3 single-stream number.

### DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION (both A/Bs)
**The 0.23.1 migration introduced ZERO speed regression on ANY model** — proven apples-to-
apples (same config, dev491 vs 0.23.1):
- 35B-A3B: 230 (0.23.1) — matches/exceeds the skill's 211 single-stream reference.
- 27B tq-k8v4: 118.8 (0.23.1) ≈ 120.0 (dev491) — matches the skill's ~120 single-stream ref.
- Gemma-31B: ~40 (0.23.1) ≈ 35.9 (dev491).

The user's higher targets (27B 156, Gemma-31B 110, Gemma-26B 200, DiffusionGemma 200) are
**not the canonical single-stream tq + MTP-K3 numbers** — they come from a different axis:
- **Multi-concurrency throughput** (skill ref: 27B **292 @ conc=4**, 35B **644 @ conc=8**) —
  the single-stream genesis_bench_suite measures conc=1.
- **A different/faster model** — Gemma-4-**26B A4B** (4B-active MoE) is far faster than the
  31B dense; it is the "200+" model (I have not benched it yet — boot it next).
- **Block-diffusion** (DiffusionGemma) — needs a block-aware harness, not autoregressive TPS.

So there is **nothing regressed to "re-tune"** — the deep-retuning premise is void. To hit
the higher numbers the user remembers, the lever is **config/concurrency/model choice**, not
a 0.23.1 kernel fix. Recommended next: bench multi-concurrency (conc=4) + the 26B-A4B MoE.

## 4. ⚠ 27B speed gap (120 vs 140-156) — RESOLVED: no regression (see §3d/§3e)

27B INT4 hybrid TQ + MTP K=3 canonical = 120 TPS, below the historical 140-156. Launcher
params are IDENTICAL to the historical PROD launcher (max-num-seqs 4, batched 4096, MTP
K=3, gpu 0.82). My version-caps did NOT touch perf patches (the 16 still-capped are all
superseded/parser, not perf). So the gap is a 0.23.1-vs-old-pin characteristic — likely
GDN/Mamba int4 kernel perf OR MTP accept-rate on 0.23.1. Needs: bench 27B with accept-rate
captured; compare GDN kernel path 0.23.1 vs dev491. (Follow-up after Gemma fix.)

---

## 5. Deferred (user decision)

- **sndr-daemon migration** dev259→0.23.1 (for strict ≤2 images) — denied by the auto
  classifier as sensitive shared infra (docker.sock/admin-pass/host-net).
- **apply_shadow spec_boot_unsafe** (P1/P17/P20/P32 legacy hooks, no apply_module) —
  pre-existing Phase-4 legacy→spec migration.
- **PN389 test suite** (tests/, untracked) asserts the old 3-file contract — needs rewrite.
- **DiffusionGemma speed** needs a block-diffusion-aware bench harness (autoregressive
  wall_TPS measurement gives a misleading ~31).

## 7. Upstream regression audit + 5-axis code verification (2026-06-18)

Per the /loop directive ("study the engine github for regressions/solutions; re-audit our
kernels — maybe we missed something"). One research agent over vllm-project/vllm + a 5-agent
workflow cross-checking findings against our tree.

### 7a. Upstream window — CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH
The real migration span is **128 commits, 2026-06-13 → 2026-06-17** (pin 4c6266331 dated
06-17 04:38Z), NOT April-May. Every in-window change touching the Genesis stack is **additive
or a fix** — zero regressions:
- **#45473** (DS Mamba tail-copy for MTP align mode) — IN pin, improves the 27B hybrid+MTP path.
- **#45707** (restore MoE routed-output unpadding before shared-expert add) — IN pin, MoE
  correctness fix (Gemma-4-26B-A4B benefits).
- **Parser reorg #45588 + 4 follow-up hotfixes** (#45553/#45795/#45832/#45413) — ALL in pin.
  Gemma-4/Qwen3 tool-calling runs the FIXED engine-based parser, not a freshly-broken one.
This is fully consistent with the A/B benches (§3d/§3e): no in-window regression → no speed loss.

### 7b. WATCH list (open upstream, NOT in pin — none proven to bite, but relevant)
- **#42271 — MTP + FULL_AND_PIECEWISE cudagraph deadlock at multi-concurrency** (bonus-token-
  only batched-decode shape). Workaround: `cudagraph_mode=FULL_DECODE_ONLY`. **This is the most
  likely reason the historical multi-concurrency peaks (27B@conc4≈156/conc8≈379, Gemma-26B-MoE@200)
  are hard to reproduce on 0.23.1** — those peaks were captured on dev338/dev371 (2026-05-15),
  which PREDATE #42271. It is a pre-existing upstream bug, NOT introduced by our migration.
- **#44209** — non-deterministic KV-cache reservation on hybrid GDN Qwen3.6 → cudagraph-capture
  OOM. Exact 27B arch; symptom reported sm120 (we are sm86). Mitigation PN367 exists (see 7c).
- **#42261** — Gemma4 + MTP device-side-assert (only repro'd at 8 spec tokens / 31B on H200;
  we run K=3/K=4). Low risk, watch the Gemma MTP configs.

### 7c. 5-axis verification of findings against OUR code
1. **parser-import-audit** → 1 real tail. **G4_14** (gemma4 pad-strip, default_on, stable)
   wraps `Gemma4ToolParser.extract_tool_calls_streaming` — a class DELETED by #45588. The new
   `Gemma4EngineToolParser` + `gemma4_utils.parse_tool_calls` is a full rewrite
   (skip_special_tokens=False + structured `vllm.parser.gemma4._parse_gemma4_args`); the #39392
   raw-token pad-leak MODE no longer exists in that architecture. G4_14 graceful-skips on 0.23.1
   (never failed=0 boot). **ACTION TAKEN: capped G4_14 to `<0.23.0`** with a full deep-diff note
   (registry.py G4_14 block), consistent with PN30/PN56/P64. #39392 still OPEN upstream — if a
   live gemma4 tool-call repro shows the leak on the new parser, redesign against
   `Gemma4EngineToolParser` with a failing test FIRST, then lift the cap. All other deleted-target
   parser patches (PN56/P64/P61c/P29_HEAL qwen3coder; P12/P27/P59/P61b/PN51 reasoning) already
   graceful-skip and/or are version-capped → no boot-failure risk.
2. **gemma-parser-config** → CLEAN. All 5 Gemma configs declare `tool_call_parser: gemma4`
   (the engine-native name), `reasoning_parser: null`. No deleted/renamed parser referenced.
3. **#42271 cudagraph risk** → CONFIRMED on our surface. Both Qwen models (35B + 27B) run
   MTP K=3 on `attention_arch=hybrid_gdn_moe` with `cudagraph_mode=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` (schema
   default + PN125/G4_16 force it). `FULL_DECODE_ONLY` is whitelisted in schema.py:361 but wired
   NOWHERE (0 configs/profiles/launchers). The 27B latency profile already runs max_num_seqs=4.
   **RULE for 0.23.1 multi-conc benching: launch with `--cudagraph-mode FULL_DECODE_ONLY` to dodge
   the #42271 hang.** Disabling PN125 does NOT help — the engine default is still FULL_AND_PIECEWISE.
4. **#44209 hybrid-GDN** → PN367 (vendors vllm#44745/#44740, clamps the negative/non-deterministic
   cudagraph-capture memory delta — the exact #44209 mode) EXISTS and its range was bumped to
   `<0.24.0` on 06-17 (covers 0.23.1). BUT the **deployed 27B launcher is strict opt-in** (no
   `GENESIS_LEGACY_DEFAULT_ON=1` — that flag lives only in the launcher TEMPLATE, not the rendered
   rig script), so default_on=True is informational and **PN367 is inert on the live 27B**. It is
   a DEFENSIVE guard only — the 27B boots clean (failed=0) and the symptom is sm120-specific.
   RECOMMENDATION (low prio, defensive): add `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN367: '1'` to the 27B configs +
   re-render, then verify the clamp logs on boot. Not urgent.
5. **supersession #45473/#45707** → PN30 (overlaps #45473) is ALREADY correctly capped `<0.23.0`
   (done during migration). #45707 has NO Genesis overlap (clean). Nothing to retire/update.

### 7d. Two agent claims DEBUNKED by live/source check
- "PN517 env-flag typo `n_INIT...`" → FALSE. a5000-2x YAML:155 and the deployed launcher both
  carry the correct `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN517_INIT_SNAPSHOT_BEFORE_NCCL=1`. The `n_INIT` was a
  transcript-rendering artifact of the agent's own grep tool (same bug rendered `gemma4`→`ln4`).
- "PN367 mitigation missing" → it EXISTS and is version-eligible; it is merely not opted-in
  (see 7c.4). The capability is present, the wiring is a deliberate strict-opt-in choice.

### 7e. Open item — Gemma-4-26B-A4B MoE boot (the "200+" model, still unbenched) + a PROD-down incident
The 26B MoE bench (`bench26b.sh`) FAILED and took 35B PROD down with it — a repeat of the
leftover-container class (iron-rule lesson I had already recorded, re-violated). Two compounding
bugs in my bench script:
1. **Wrong port assumption.** `start_gemma4_26b_0231.sh` binds port **8003**, but `bench26b.sh`
   assumed **8102** for the health-wait, the SUITE call, AND the teardown
   (`docker ps --filter publish=8102`). So health never saw the 26B (it was on 8003) → the bench
   produced empty results, AND the teardown matched nothing → the 26B was left running.
2. **Leftover starves PROD.** The orphaned `vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` (Up 27 min, ~22 GiB on both
   cards) then starved the `start_qwen3.6-35b-balanced.sh` restore → 35B crashed with
   `ValueError: Free memory on device cuda:1 (1.73/23.55 GiB) on startup is less than desired`
   (exit 1). PROD was down ~8 min until diagnosed.

**Fix applied:** `docker rm -f vllm-gemma4-26b-a4b-test` (explicit name), GPU freed, 35B relaunched
on 8102, verified. **Hardened lesson (again):** every rig bench MUST (a) read the launcher's real
`--port`, never assume; (b) tear down by explicit container NAME, never `--filter publish`;
(c) verify GPU is actually free (`nvidia-smi` < 1.5 GiB) before launching the next model.

The 26B MoE itself remains unbenched. Its dedicated diagnostic must use **port 8003**, an explicit
container-name teardown, a ≥20-min boot window with boot-log capture, and must run only when no
PROD model needs the GPU. Once it boots: bench single-stream AND (with `--cudagraph-mode
FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, per #42271) multi-conc to chase the 200+ peak.

**UPDATE — 26B MoE RESOLVED (bulletproof diagnostic, port 8003, GPU verified free):**
The "boot >12 min" was the SAME port-mismatch bug — the health probe hit 8102 while the 26B
listens on **8003**, so it never observed the (already-healthy) container. With the probe on the
real port the 26B boots cleanly:
- **health=200 at 210s (3.5 min)** on 0.23.1rc1.dev101 — no slow boot, no stall.
- single-stream **wall_TPS = 106.4** (CV 0.38 — high MoE-routing variance), decode_TPOT 11.8 ms.
- **tool-call works:** `get_weather{"city": "Kyiv"}`.
- 35B PROD restored afterward (health=200), GPU verified free at each transition.
Boot log carried one benign `llm_base_proposer: Draft model does not support …` MTP warning.
So ALL models boot + tool-call on 0.23.1 (35B 230, 27B 120, Gemma-31B ~40, Gemma-26B-MoE 106 —
all single-stream). The 26B "200+" is, like the others, a **multi-concurrency** number gated by
the open upstream #42271 — reachable on 0.23.1 with `--cudagraph-mode FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, not lost
to the pin. The bulletproof diagnostic (explicit names, real port, GPU-free gates, guaranteed
restore) is the template for all future rig benches.

### 7f. Net conclusion of the audit
The migration is **correct and complete**; the upstream window introduced **no regression**.
The single code tail found (G4_14) is now honestly scoped (capped <0.23.0). The high historical
numbers are a **multi-concurrency / config axis** gated by the open upstream #42271 deadlock —
reachable on 0.23.1 via `FULL_DECODE_ONLY`, not via any "lost" kernel. PN367 is a free defensive
hardening opt-in for the 27B if desired.

## 8. Speed-recovery deep study (2026-06-18) — evidence-based, per-model + external repos

Operator directive: "числа были на сингле не на мульте; изучай, анализируй, адаптируй патчи;
изучай репозитории и находи лучшее решение для каждого патча чтобы ускорить модели. Не гадай."
A 4-agent ultracode Workflow studied each model's speed stack + historical bench evidence +
external repos (vllm/sglang/fla-org/QwenLM-FlashQLA/tfriedel-lab). EVERY number is cited.

### 8a. Target reconciliation — the high single-stream targets were a different MEASUREMENT, not lost speed
- **27B "156"** = multi-concurrency conc=4. Highest CLEAN single-stream ever recorded = **138.4
  (median 143.4)** on pin dev259 (2026-06-10-27b-campaign-breakthrough.md:7), a high-MTP-accept
  CODE-content run; "150+" was explicitly a goal never hit. genesis_bench_suite neutral content = ~120.
- **Gemma-31B ">110"** = NOT substantiated for the 31B-dense anywhere on the rig (max ever ~78,
  kv-auto). The 109/142 are external club-3090 2×3090 numbers (MTP n=4, different checkpoint);
  the 114/101 cited as ">110" were the **26B-A4B MoE**, not the 31B dense.
- **26B "200"** = a DIFFERENT harness: multi_conc_bench conc=1 code-prompts = 202.9
  (g4_26b_a4b_multiconc VERDICT:55, which itself warns it is NOT comparable to genesis_bench_suite);
  greedy short-output (T=0, max_tokens=350) on dev354 gave 150/216/227. genesis_bench_suite = 106-114 K=1.
- **35B** = the targets (208 standard / 228-255 code/structured) are MET and are the CURRENT stack.

So the genesis_bench_suite single-stream numbers were always lower than the remembered peaks —
the peaks are real but live on the multi-conc axis, the code/greedy-short methodology, or a
different model/checkpoint. NOT a pin regression (A/B-proven), NOT a lost/gated patch (every
version-capped patch verified native-in-engine or bench-null against the live 0.23.1 source).

### 8b. REAL, substantiated speed levers (the constructive output)
1. **🥇 Gemma-31B 40 → ~78 (≈2×): drop TurboQuant-KV → kv-auto/FP8 for the chat profile.**
   TurboQuant VQ KV ~halves decode (rig: kv-auto/32K = 78.4 vs TQ = 25.8-40.7). TQ is a
   256K-CONTEXT-UNLOCK feature being run at 4K/65K where it buys nothing. The MTP-K3-not-accepting
   smoking-gun was REFUTED — MTP K=3 (G4_81 route) = +10% net-positive. CAVEAT: kv-auto on SM86 has
   an IMA-crash-on-burst landmine (PR #45038 / extend G4_31 guard) at multi-conc; single-stream is
   safe. Keep a separate TQ profile only for >32K long-context.
   **✅ VALIDATED on 0.23.1 (A/B bqixwbunp, same MTP K=3, same harness, both failed=0 + tool-call OK):**
   TURBOQUANT = **35.5 wall_TPS / TPOT 38.95ms** vs kv-auto = **71.6 wall_TPS / TPOT 11.48ms** =
   **×2.02 faster**. TPOT collapse 39→11.5ms confirms TurboQuant-KV was the decode sink (~11.5ms is
   the expected 4-bit-dense-31B floor on A5000). Cost: 32K vs 256K context. Decision: kv-auto = chat
   default; keep a TQ long-ctx profile for >32K. kv-auto CV high (0.365 — MTP bimodal + no Gemma
   warmup orchestrator yet); median solid ~71.6.
2. **27B 120 → ~138: two never-validated warp knobs + content-matched bench.**
   GENESIS_P67_NUM_WARPS 4→8 A/B (the 2026-06-14 hardware opt forced 4, contradicting the P67
   kernel's validated SM86 default of 8; unvalidated on 27B); VLLM_TQ_DECODE_NUM_WARPS 8→4 A/B
   (the +1.26% long-ctx win was only proven on 35B). Plus: capture MTP accept-rate + a code-content
   canonical bench (the 138 peak was high-accept code content; the YAML reference_metrics_ref is null).
3. **26B MoE: `--no-enable-prefix-caching` on the MTP profiles** (external tfriedel/qwen3.6-rtx3090-lab
   + vLLM: MTP decode-rate win is gated by prefix-cache OFF; no Genesis 26B profile sets it). Keep
   K=1 for long-form (K=4 is −11%/−53% — 128-expert routing on each draft token). Re-validate the
   26B on 0.23.1 (pin-held at dev259; G4_18 per-layer-KV + G4_08 K-pad no-op above 0.22).
4. **35B: at the latency-bound ceiling** (SM 90-98%, power 76%, mem 47%, ~0.8 MTP-accept wall). No
   gate/config lever; only Blackwell or a higher-accept drafter moves it.

### 8c. Patch-level conclusions (iron-rule #11 verified against live 0.23.1 source)
- **NO decode-speed or spec-decode-enablement patch is wrongly version-gated OFF.** Every capped
  speed-relevant patch (PN30/PN133/PN378/PN22) verified NATIVE in the pinned engine
  (mamba_utils.py:304, scheduler.py:1543, rejection_sampler.py:929, interfaces.py:1285) or
  bench-null (PN125 206.26 vs 206.23; SNDR_MTP_DYNAMIC_K_001 p=0.57/0.93). G4_14 (capped this
  session) is tool-call, not decode — correct.
- **No faster GDN/Mamba kernel exists for SM86**: FLA fused_recurrent decode is num_warps=1 fixed
  (no headroom); QwenLM/FlashQLA + FlashInfer-GDN require SM90+. Genesis PN296/299 already prune
  the FLA prefill warps for SM86 (AHEAD of upstream FLA).
- **External backports**: only OPEN candidate is vllm#45703 (Marlin MoE thread-tile padding) for
  the 27B INT4 — verify-before-vendor (no-op if the shard is on-tile). #45473 already in pin,
  #45849 N/A (KV-connector), #43955 already vendored as PN340/PN341 (our biggest 35B wins).
- **Hygiene**: remove the stale `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN90_PROBABILISTIC_DRAFT='1'` from the 27B YAML
  (retired+gated inert; technique re-measured −5.9% — a future un-cap would silently regress).
  Mark the dated "185 TPS A5000 ceiling" memo SUPERSEDED (it was pin 0.19.2; current 35B = 208-255).

### 8d. Honest bottom line
The migration lost nothing; the system is correct and at/near its real ceilings on most models.
The ONE large recoverable win is **Gemma-31B ≈2× by dropping TurboQuant for chat** (validating now).
The rest are single-digit-% config knobs (worth A/B'ing) — there is no hidden 156/110/200
single-stream waiting behind a disabled patch; those numbers are multi-conc / code-content / a
different model. "Don't guess" honored: every claim here cites a bench file, registry line, pin
source line, or external PR/URL.

## 9. ROOT CAUSE — TurboQuant decode + MTP, and the operator's thesis confirmed (2026-06-18)

Operator's strategic correction (verbatim intent): "don't wash your hands by switching to kv-auto —
FIND the problem and FIX it (keep 256K AND get speed); MTP must work everywhere; the engine changed
since ~April 15 (1900 commits / 300 files), so patches that still APPLY but were never rewritten for
the new code format silently break/slow things — study the engine changes and rewrite the patches."
A 3-agent root-cause Workflow (wdtwlswjh) confirmed this exactly, with code citations.

### 9a. TurboQuant decode is 2× slower for a COMPUTE reason, NOT memory — and it is FIXABLE
TQ packs 262 B/token vs bf16's 1024 B = **3.9× LESS** HBM traffic, so the quantized cache cannot
itself be the +27ms/token cost. The real chain (all cited):
- `turboquant_4bit_nc` = 4-bit **MSE keys** (key_fp8=False) → forces the **scalar** `_tq_decode_stage1`
  kernel with **ZERO tl.dot** — QK/PV via `tl.sum` on CUDA cores, not tensor cores
  (overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py:327,365-368,467; tl.dot=0 in overlay AND club-3090 ref).
- Per-token **centroid gather + norm renormalize** that kv-auto never pays (random-access, 1 warp
  can't latency-hide) — :350-354,357-363.
- Launched **num_warps=1 / num_stages=1 / BLOCK_KV=4** (H100-MHA defaults) → 512 single-warp CTAs
  (:798,893-894).
- GQA group=2 → each KV head dequantized **2×** because the grouped + P67 tensor-core kernels are
  **hard-gated to FP8 keys** (tq_grouped_decode.py:338-340).
- 🔑 **P18b** (the patch meant to retune num_warps) is **DEAD**: its anchors expect a 12-space
  two-branch GQA/MHA block (p18b_*.py:66-84) but the overlay has an 8-space single launch → both
  anchors test False → soft-skip → num_warps stays 1. **This is the operator's thesis incarnate: an
  engine-code-format change silently disabled a speed patch (NOT failed=0, just inert).**

**FIXABLE, not inherent** (KIVI arXiv:2402.02750 + our own FP8 grouped kernel prove fused
dequant-into-tl.dot is fast on Ampere). Three rig-validatable fixes, all keep 256K context + help 27B/35B:
1. **Repair P18b anchors** (low risk) → num_warps 8 / stages 3 / BLOCK_KV 16 → TPOT 39 → ~27-33ms.
2. **Add an MSE-key branch to the grouped tl.dot kernel** (medium risk, the BIG win) → moves MSE-key
   QK/PV onto tensor cores + loads each KV head ONCE per BLOCK_H group → **TPOT 39 → ~14-18ms**
   (near the bf16 11.5ms floor) while keeping 3.9× KV compression. **256K AND fast — the real fix.**
3. **Hoist the FP16 Hadamard rotation/re-dequant out of the MTP K+1 verify loop** (PN240/P65 path).

### 9b. MTP — net-positive on 35B/27B/31B; the ONE net-negative is 26B-MoE K=4-at-batch-1
- 35B K=3 = 72.9% accept, +32%. 27B K=3 net-positive. 31B-dense K=3 = +10% (accept inferred, never
  measured). **26B-A4B MoE K=4 batch=1 = −11%/−53%** because the MoE verify pass loads the union of
  per-draft-token expert sets (128 experts × top_k=8) with NO amortization at batch=1 (~9.86× K=1
  forward even at mean k=3.49). At **K=3 the same 26B = +65% on chat.**
- Fixes (make MTP universal): (1) make 26B **K=3 the chat DEFAULT** (the validated
  gemma4-26b-mtp-chat-k3 profile exists but is mis-routed role=structured); gate K=4 to batch≥4; MTP
  OFF for 26B long-ctx. (2) **PN384** (vendor vllm#44986, fixes MTP dropping the last prefix-cache
  block, 92%→71% hit) EXISTS but is default-OFF + in zero composes — enable on all MTP composes
  (another "filed but not wired" instance of the thesis). (3) **Accept-rate instrumentation**
  (PN282 / SNDR_ENABLE_SPEC_DECODE_ACCEPTANCE_METRIC=1) on every MTP compose so accept is MEASURED,
  not inferred. (4) Refresh the pr42637 kv_cache_utils overlay for the pin's `get_kv_cache_capacity`
  rename so 31B-tq MTP boots (engine API rename broke it — thesis again).

### 9c. Pin update (operator instruction "обновись на новый pin — там много исправлений")
Authorized per the pin policy (explicit instruction). Scope established: April-15 baseline =
vLLM 03f8d3a54 (dev9/dev16 era — what most patches were WRITTEN for); April-15 → our pin 4c6266331 =
**1900 commits / 300 files**; our pin is 54 commits behind main (5fd3b276f, today). Pulling the latest
nightly now; will re-tag per policy (new=current, 4c626633=previous), CLEAN the 3rd stale pin
(303916e93 dev259 — currently violates the ≤2 rule) + dev491, then boot-validate apply/smoke/tool-call
on the new pin. The engine-change → patch-rewrite program (TQ kernel + MTP above being the first slice)
targets THIS new pin.

### 9d. The thesis, proven
Three patches caught silently inert from engine-code changes — NOT failed=0, just doing nothing:
P18b (anchor format 12→8 space), PN384 (filed, never wired), pr42637 overlay (get_kv_cache_capacity
rename). "Applies cleanly" ≠ "still correct/effective." The recovery path is real and code-cited:
fix the TQ kernel (256K AND ~14-18ms TPOT) + wire MTP correctly everywhere.

## 10. FIX 1 validated on dev148 — P18b REVIVED, but warp-tune is speed-neutral → FIX 2 is the lever

A/B on dev148 (Gemma-4-31B TURBOQUANT, genesis_bench_suite, bulletproof, 35B restored clean):

| Variant | apply | P18b marker in live kernel | live num_warps / BLOCK_KV | wall_TPS | TPOT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BASE (no tune env) | failed=0 | **present** | 1/4/8, BLOCK_KV=32 | 38.5 | 39.1ms |
| TUNED (warps=8/stages=3/blk=16) | failed=0 | present (idempotent) | 1/4/8, BLOCK_KV=32 | 37.6 | 38.9ms |

**FIX 1 PRIMARY GOAL ACHIEVED:** the re-anchored P18b APPLIES on dev148 (marker present, log
"applied/idempotent" — NOT the old silent soft-skip). The dead patch is revived. Pin dev148
boots Gemma TQ failed=0 (applied=70). This proves the operator's thesis-fix: rewriting the
anchors for the new single-launch engine format makes the patch live again.

**BUT the warp/block tune is SPEED-NEUTRAL.** The live kernel was already at num_warps=8 /
BLOCK_KV=32 and TPOT stayed 39ms; BASE≈TUNED. Occupancy is NOT the bottleneck. This empirically
confirms the root cause: the decode kernel (overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py — 937 LOC,
**tl.sum×6, tl.dot×0**, fully scalar) computes QK via `tl.sum(q_rot*c_vals)` and PV via
`tl.sum(p*values)` on CUDA cores, with a per-token MSE centroid gather (Centroids_ptr+mse_idx,
:347-366). No amount of warps hides the scalar gather. **The ONLY lever that recovers speed while
keeping TurboQuant's 256K context is FIX 2: route the MSE-key path onto tensor cores (tl.dot).**

### Refined plan
- FIX 1: DONE as a patch-revival (correct, keep it — it lets the env-tune wire through), but it is
  NOT a speed win on its own. Leave VLLM_TQ_DECODE_NUM_WARPS=8 (free, marginal).
- **FIX 2 (the real one)**: build the MSE-key tile inside the decode kernel (gather centroids into a
  [BLOCK_KV, BLOCK_D] k-tile + apply vec_norms) and replace the scalar `tl.sum` QK/PV with
  `tl.dot(q, kᵀ)` / `tl.dot(p, values)` — the KIVI/KVQuant fused-dequant-into-MMA pattern, already
  proven on A5000 by our FP8 grouped kernel. Target the live decode kernel
  (overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py). Expected TPOT 39→~14-18ms while keeping 3.9× KV
  compression. This is careful Triton work needing numerical-equivalence validation (output parity
  vs the scalar kernel) + rig A/B — the next focused effort.
- FIX 3 (MTP everywhere) proceeds in parallel (config-level: 26B K=3 default, PN384, accept-rate).

## 11. 🔴 BIGGEST FINDING — PN119 (the tensor-core TQ decode) is SILENTLY INERT on PROD (md5 drift)

Pre-FIX2 research (six-step Search) + a live-check on the running 35B PROD container produced the
decisive evidence — and it is the operator's thesis on the single highest-value speed patch.

**Live 35B PROD kernel (`vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_turboquant_decode.py`):**
`tl.dot count = 0`, `_tq_grouped_decode_stage1 = 0`, `PN119 marker = 0`, `tl.sum = 6`. The decode is
**fully scalar.** Exact reason from the live apply log:
```
⚠️ PN119 TurboQuant k8v4 GQA head grouping kernel (vllm#40792) —
   drift: file md5 16ab87ca391f40cd46aa996638721bd4 != [expected e93d6f9eb591e0b68a50b0fc2eb689c3]
```
PN119 is ENABLED (GENESIS_ENABLE_PN119=1 on BOTH 35B and 27B launchers, default_on=True) but its
**md5 pre-patch guard** (`PN119_PRE_PATCH_MD5 = e93d6f9...`, authored against dev338) no longer
matches the engine kernel (dev101 = `16ab87ca...`). The engine reshaped `triton_turboquant_decode.py`
between dev338→dev101, the full-file md5 drifted, the guard fired, PN119 self-skipped — a WARNING,
NOT a failed=0. **So 27B AND 35B PROD have been running SCALAR TQ attention decode**, with the
load-bearing FP8-key GQA tensor-core grouped kernel (`tl.dot(q,kᵀ)`/`tl.dot(p,values)`, BLOCK_H=16)
silently off. This is exactly "applies-cleanly is not still-effective" — the md5 guard is the
honest version (it WARNS), but the net effect is the same silent speed loss as P18b.

**Impact:** Gemma-31B (dense, ~100% attention) pays the full scalar penalty (39ms vs ~14-18ms
achievable). 27B/35B (hybrid GDN+MoE, ~27% attention) pay a partial penalty — a real slice of the
27B 120-vs-138 gap. PN119 being off ALSO means there was never a live tensor-core base to extend, so
FIX 2 (Gemma MSE) was mis-scoped: the real work is to REVIVE PN119 for dev148 FIRST (FP8-key
tensor-core decode for 27B/35B), THEN extend its grouped kernel to the MSE-key path (Gemma).

**Research verdict on FIX 2 (do NOT write from scratch):** PN119's `pn119_kernel.diff` IS the tl.dot
grouped template (QK + PV through tensor cores); it just gates `key_fp8 and kv_group_size>1` and
falls back to scalar for MSE presets. CommVQ (ICML'25, arXiv 2506.18879, `commvq/triton_kernels.py`)
is the per-token-codebook reference to lift the MSE centroid-gather-into-tile (HIGH adaptability);
TurboMind/XQA give the SM80 dequant-in-loop + scale-hoist discipline. KIVI/KVQuant are NEGATIVE
references (scalar). Tensor-core decode pays off because of GQA (ratio 8 on 27B/35B; ratio 2 on
Gemma-31B → smaller but positive).

**Other silently-inert suspects to live-check (same class):** PN351 (triton_unified_attention triple
anchor), P87 (marlin dual anchor), PN32 (GDN file-split), PN14 (grouped-kernel clamp gap), P40
(GQA-grouped decode, opt-in, NOT enabled). P18b is COUPLED to PN119 (requires_patches) — with PN119
inert, P18b's tune lands on the scalar kernel (no effect, as §10 measured).

### Revised priority
1. **Revive PN119 for dev148** — re-author `pn119_kernel.diff` + `PN119_PRE_PATCH_MD5` against the
   live dev148 kernel; validate tl.dot present + bench 27B/35B (tensor-core FP8-key decode back on).
2. **Extend the revived grouped kernel to the MSE-key path** (FIX 2, Gemma) — centroid gather into
   the [BLOCK_KV, BLOCK_D] tile + reuse the tl.dot machinery (CommVQ pattern).
3. Then re-check P18b/PN351/P87/PN32 on dev148 for the same md5/anchor drift.

### 11-CORRECTION — PN119 inert is an APPLY-ORDER bug, NOT a pin drift (pristine md5 MATCHES)

Verified the actual mechanism (live 35B apply log, ordered):
- The dev148 AND dev101 **pristine** `triton_turboquant_decode.py` md5 = **`e93d6f9eb591e0b68a50b0fc2eb689c3`**
  — EXACTLY PN119's expected `PN119_PRE_PATCH_MD5`. So the pin kernel is fine; PN119 would apply on
  the pristine file. The earlier "pin drift" framing in §11 is WRONG.
- Live apply order: line 154 **P18B_TEXT applied** (modifies the kernel) → line 172 **PN119 skipped**
  with `drift: md5 aaaf21e384d4…` (the md5 AFTER P18b's edit). P18b (+ PN130 warmup, PN14 clamp) all
  touch `triton_turboquant_decode.py` BEFORE PN119, so PN119's WHOLE-FILE md5 guard sees a
  P18b-modified file and self-skips.
- **The irony:** P18b `requires_patches` PN119 (P18b tunes PN119's grouped-kernel launch), yet P18b
  applies FIRST and breaks PN119. The dependency order is inverted / not enforced (no ordinal or
  requires_patches ordering wired in the registry — all three are family=attention.turboquant and
  ordered by dispatch registration).

**Correct root cause:** apply-ORDERING bug + an over-strict whole-file md5 guard. PN119 must apply
FIRST (on the pristine e93d6f9 kernel, injecting the grouped tl.dot kernel); P18b/PN14/PN130 must
apply AFTER (they tune/clamp/warm PN119's kernel). Today the order is reversed → PN119 dead →
27B/35B run scalar TQ attention decode.

**Fix (clean, low-risk, no kernel re-authoring):** make PN119 apply before the other
attention.turboquant text-patches — EITHER (a) enforce ordering (PN119 first in the dispatch list /
add an apply_order/requires-driven sort), OR (b) robustify PN119's guard to md5 only the anchor
REGION it rewrites (which P18b/PN14 do not touch) instead of the whole file, OR (c) snapshot the
pristine kernel md5 at process start before any TQ patch runs. Then: validate `tl.dot`>0 in the live
kernel + bench 27B/35B (tensor-core FP8-key decode restored) + the P18b tune lands on the grouped
kernel. THEN extend to the MSE-key path for Gemma (FIX 2, CommVQ pattern). This single ordering fix
revives the highest-value decode optimization for ALL three TQ models.

## 12. ✅ FIX-0 PROVEN on the rig — PN119 tensor-core decode = +11.5% on 27B

Clean A/B on 27B-TQ-k8v4, dev148, identical launcher, ONLY P18b toggled:

| Variant | tl.dot (live kernel) | _tq_grouped_decode_stage1 | PN119 | wall_TPS | TPOT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BASE (P18b ON, current PROD) | 0 | 0 | **skipped** (md5 drift b8f844…) | 107.8 | 9.03ms |
| NOP18B (P18b OFF) | **5** | **2** | **applied** | **120.2** | **8.09ms** |

Disabling P18b → PN119 applies on the pristine kernel → tensor-core grouped decode →
**27B 107.8 → 120.2 = +11.5%** (TPOT −10%), both failed=0. So the current PROD 27B (P18b on) has
been running the SCALAR path at ~108; fixing the order recovers ~120. PN119's apply() (line 142)
hard-skips on a whole-file md5 mismatch BEFORE its own `patch --dry-run` (line 173) — the dry-run is
the real guard, the md5 is redundant + brittle. P18b modifies the kernel first → md5 drifts →
PN119 self-skips. FIX: PN119 must apply on the pristine kernel (before P18b), OR its md5 hard-skip
must be downgraded so the dry-run decides. Implementing next; then re-bench to confirm +11.5% with
the proper fix (not just P18b-off).

## 13. ⚠️ SELF-CORRECTION — my P18b re-anchor (§10, commit d2b9fd58) was the REGRESSION; reverted

Reading P18b's own registry comment (registry.py:8003-8007) corrected my §10/§11 framing:
- P18b declares `requires_patches: ["PN119"]` and its ORIGINAL 12-space GQA/MHA anchors target
  **PN119's OUTPUT** (the grouped kernel's if/else launchers), NOT the pristine kernel. The pristine
  kernel has a SINGLE 8-space launcher; the 12-space if/else only exists AFTER PN119 injects it.
- So the ORIGINAL P18b was NOT "dead from format change" — it correctly **soft-skips on the pristine
  single-launch** (anchors don't match) and only fires once PN119 has run. With the topo sort OFF
  (PN119 hasn't run yet when P18b is reached), P18b harmlessly soft-skips, leaving the file pristine
  → **PN119 then applies cleanly (md5 matches) → tensor-core decode → the historical 27B ~120.**
- **My §10 re-anchor (to the single 8-space launch) BROKE this:** it made P18b MATCH the pristine
  scalar launcher and modify it → md5 drift → PN119 self-skips → scalar decode → 27B 108. The 27B
  A/B's "BASE 107.8" was running MY regressed P18b. So §10's "P18b revived" was wrong — I converted a
  correctly-dormant patch into an active one that breaks its own dependency.

**Reverted commit d2b9fd58** (restored the original 12-space anchors). Expected effect: P18b
soft-skips on pristine again → PN119 applies → 27B back to ~120 (the NOP18B A/B number) WITHOUT
disabling P18b. The historical 120 was always PN119-working; my re-anchor was the only regressor.

**Remaining genuine improvement (secondary, ~neutral per §10):** enable the opt-in topo sort
(`SNDR_TOPO_SORT_SPECS=1`, already built — orchestrator.py) so PN119 applies BEFORE P18b and P18b
actually tunes PN119's grouped launchers (instead of soft-skipping). The dependency is already
declared. To validate next: 27B with reverted P18b (no topo) → expect ~120 + PN119 applied + tl.dot>0.
Lesson: a patch that "doesn't apply" may be CORRECTLY dormant pending its dependency — check
requires_patches before "reviving" it.

### 13-CONFIRMED — revert validated + deployed; PN119 tensor-core decode restored on PROD
27B dev148 with reverted P18b: **tl.dot=5 (PN119 grouped kernel live), PN119 applied, P18b applied,
wall_TPS 118.7** (TPOT 8.15ms) — vs my regressed 107.8. Live 35B PROD re-verified: **tl.dot=5,
PN119 applied, health=200**. The regression I introduced (P18b re-anchor d2b9fd58) is fully resolved
on PROD; 27B/35B run tensor-core TQ decode again. NET: no loss vs pre-session (~120 restored);
the only NEW genuine win remaining is FIX 2 (Gemma MSE-key tensor-core decode, 39→~14-18ms — Gemma
is the one model PN119's FP8-key gate doesn't cover, so its scalar penalty is real and unaddressed).

## 14. FIX 2 (Gemma MSE tensor-core) — implemented + parity-proven + SAFE, but blocked by PN119 apply-order

Implementer extended PN119's grouped tl.dot kernel with an MSE-key branch (centroid-gather into a
[BLOCK_KV, BLOCK_D] tile, vec_norms fold, reusing the existing tl.dot), relaxed the gate to
`kv_group_size > 1 and value_quant_bits == 4`, recomputed hunk headers. **Parity test: 25 passed**
(head_dim 64/128/256, group 2/4/8, norm on/off — bit-exact index unpack + centroid gather + the
`vec_norms*sum(q*c) == sum(q*(vec_norms*c))` fold identity). **Dry-run against the pristine dev148
kernel (md5 e93d6f9): applies (rc=0, fuzz 1), patched kernel py-syntax OK.**

Rig validation on Gemma-31B-TQ (dev101, reverted P18b + FIX 2):
- ✅ Boots (health=200, no compile crash at BLOCK_D=256), **output COHERENT** ("The ocean covers
  more than seventy percent of the Earth's surface"), **tool-call works** (`get_weather{"city":"Odessa"}`).
  So FIX 2 does NOT break anything (no garbage, no crash) — the parity proof held.
- ⚠️ BUT `tl.dot = 0` in the live kernel → the grouped MSE kernel did NOT engage. KEY_FP8=6 is the
  pre-existing SCALAR kernel's constexpr, not FIX 2's grouped kernel. So Gemma still ran scalar.
- TPOT 21ms / 42.7 TPS (vs the earlier 39ms/35.5 measured under my BROKEN P18b) — improvement is from
  reverting P18b (pristine BLOCK_KV/num_warps) + variance (CV 0.19), NOT from FIX 2 (which didn't engage).

**Why tl.dot=0:** the SAME PN119 apply-ORDER issue. On the 27B boot PN119 applied (tl.dot=5); on the
Gemma boot a sibling kernel-modifier (a G4_* / PN14 / PN130 patch) edited triton_turboquant_decode.py
BEFORE PN119, drifting its whole-file md5 → PN119 self-skipped → FIX 2's grouped kernel never landed.
The apply order is model-dependent (different patch sets per launcher), so PN119 applies on some
models and not others — a fragile whole-file-md5 + unordered-apply interaction.

**ROOT FIX (next, careful — touches PROD):** make PN119 robust to apply-order. Two options:
(a) downgrade PN119's whole-file md5 HARD-SKIP to a warning + let its own `patch --dry-run` be the
   guard (apply if the hunks still fit despite an unrelated sibling edit; skip gracefully if they
   genuinely conflict) — contained change to pn119_tq_gqa_grouping.py apply(); OR
(b) enable the built-in opt-in topo sort `SNDR_TOPO_SORT_SPECS=1` + ensure every kernel-modifier
   declares `requires_patches:[PN119]` so PN119 always applies first on the pristine file.
Either makes PN119 (FP8 decode for 27B/35B) AND FIX 2 (MSE decode for Gemma) apply RELIABLY on every
model. Then re-validate FIX 2 on Gemma: expect tl.dot>0 + TPOT toward 14-18ms + coherent output.
FIX 2 itself is DONE + parity-proven + safe; it is gated only on PN119 reliably applying.

## 15. PN119-robustness VALIDATED on 27B/35B; FIX 2 blocked on Gemma by a PN119↔G4 dispatch conflict

Decisive rig validation of the md5-hard-skip→dry-run-guard fix + FIX 2:
- **27B (FP8 k8v4): tl.dot=8, PN119 applied, wall_TPS 118.9 / TPOT 8.19ms** — NO regression vs the
  reverted-P18b 118.7. The md5-downgrade makes PN119 apply reliably regardless of which sibling
  edited the file first, AND it carries FIX 2's MSE-branch additions (tl.dot 5→8) harmlessly on the
  FP8 path. 35B PROD restored healthy on the same code.  → **PN119-robustness is a clean win:
  27B/35B FP8 tensor-core decode is now reliable, not order-dependent.**
- **Gemma (MSE keys): tl.dot=0 STILL** — FIX 2 did NOT engage. Output coherent ("Mountains are
  majestic landforms…"), tool-call valid, no crash (FIX 2 safe). But PN119's diff did not apply on
  the Gemma boot EVEN with the md5-downgrade — meaning the `patch --dry-run` itself REJECTED PN119's
  hunks (graceful skip), i.e. a G4_* TQ patch (G4_60b/c overlay loaders, G4_67/G4_81 spec-route)
  edits the SAME `triton_turboquant_decode_attention` dispatch region PN119's diff targets, so the
  two genuinely conflict on the Gemma dispatch. The dry-run guard correctly refused to force it.

**Honest conclusion on FIX 2:** the MSE grouped kernel is correct (parity 25/25, coherent on the
FP8-carried path) but cannot be wired into Gemma's decode because PN119's context-diff conflicts
with the G4 TQ dispatch overlays that only Gemma loads. Getting Gemma onto the MSE tensor-core path
requires either (a) rebasing PN119's hunks to apply AFTER the G4 overlays (author the grouped-kernel
injection against the G4-overlaid dispatch, not the pristine one), or (b) moving the MSE branch into
the G4 decode overlay (G4_60c) instead of PN119. Both are real integration work, not a quick patch.
Gemma stays on the scalar path (~27-39ms, coherent, tool-calls valid) until then.

### Net state (honest)
- Pin dev148 ✓. My P18b regression found+fixed+deployed ✓. PN119 robust + reliable on 27B/35B
  (FP8 tensor-core decode) ✓, no regression (118.9). Thesis (engine-change/order → silent patch
  breakage) confirmed repeatedly with live evidence (§9-15).
- The one large NEW speed win (Gemma MSE tensor-core, 39→~14-18ms) is implemented + parity-proven
  but BLOCKED on the Gemma-only PN119↔G4 dispatch conflict — a deeper integration task, deferred.
- Remaining low-risk wins: FIX 3 (MTP config: 26B K=3 default, PN384, accept-rate), promote dev148
  to the live launchers, prune stale pins, re-check PN351/P87/PN32 for the same drift class.

## 16. Speed-stack re-audit (the "did we miss another inert patch" /loop directive) — CLEAN

Live 35B PROD apply-log audit of every speed-critical suspect the FIX-2 research flagged
(PN351/P87/PN32) + the active speed stack (PN286/PN340/PN341/PN350/PN29/PN368/PN390):
- **Applied (or idempotent-applied):** PN351, PN286, PN340, PN341, PN350, PN29, PN368, PN390 —
  the entire 35B tensor-core/MTP speed stack is LIVE.
- **Correctly skipped (verified reason, NOT drift):** P87 (upstream absorbed it — drift marker
  `marlin_padded_nk` present, vllm#40361 merged), PN32 (strict opt-in, GENESIS_ENABLE_PN32 unset).
Conclusion: **PN119 was the ONE silently-inert speed patch; every other suspect is either correctly
applied or correctly skipped for a verified reason.** After the PN119-robustness fix the 27B/35B
FP8 tensor-core decode stack is fully intact. No further silent-inert speed losses found.

## 17. Pin-policy housekeeping — server back to ≤2 pins
Server had 4 distinct vLLM pins (dev148, dev101, dev491, dev259), violating the ≤2 policy
(current + previous). Verified dev491 (1033ffac2) + dev259 (303916e93) are used by ZERO containers,
removed both → server now holds exactly **dev148 (current, :nightly + nightly-b4c80ec0f) + dev101
(previous/rollback, nightly-4c626633, runs the live 35B + sndr-daemon)**. Live 35B PROD re-verified:
health=200, PN119 tl.dot=8 (tensor-core decode active), failed=0. Pin-update intent: dev148 is the
validated current; promoting the LIVE launchers from dev101→dev148 (to also pick up #45849 hybrid
hidden-states NaN fix) remains a deliberate PROD-restart step — deferred to a focused window, not
forced autonomously at depth (the 35B is healthy on dev101 + all fixes).

## 18. CORRECTED FIX-2 blocker — the Gemma decode kernel is a BIND-MOUNTED overlay, not the image kernel

§15 attributed Gemma's tl.dot=0 to a "PN119↔G4 dispatch conflict". The real (deeper) reason, found
by reading G4_60c: the Gemma launcher **bind-mounts** `overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py`
(scalar, 937 LOC, with SLIDING_WINDOW + USE_MM_PREFIX branches) directly OVER
`/usr/local/.../vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_turboquant_decode.py` (`-v …:ro`). G4_60c just VERIFIES
that mount; G4_60b/d mount the attn/store companions. So on Gemma the decode kernel is the OVERLAY
file, while PN119 text-patches the IMAGE kernel IN the container — the bind-mount SHADOWS PN119's
patch entirely. That is why FIX 2 (in PN119's diff) never reached Gemma: tl.dot=0 because the scalar
overlay is what loads, not the PN119-patched image kernel. (27B/35B do NOT bind-mount this file, so
they use the PN119-patched image kernel → tl.dot=8 → tensor-core. Consistent with all observations.)

**Correct FIX-2 path for Gemma (option b, now precise):** port the parity-proven MSE grouped
tensor-core kernel (the implementer's branch + gate) INTO the overlay file
`overlays/pr42637/triton_turboquant_decode.py` itself — add a `_tq_grouped_decode_stage1` with the
MSE-key tl.dot path + a `kv_group_size>1 and value_quant_bits==4` dispatch in the overlay's
`triton_turboquant_decode_attention`. Since the overlay is bind-mounted (not patched), this is a
direct source edit (no md5/patch fragility) — the cleanest vehicle. The MSE math is already
parity-tested (25/25); this is a port + a rig coherence/TPOT A/B on Gemma. Substantial Triton work,
deferred to a focused session. PN119's diff edit (committed) is harmless on Gemma (shadowed) and
correct on 27B/35B; no revert needed.

## 19. "Bring ALL patches to full functionality on dev148" — promote + apply-matrix audit (user directive)

User directive: keep ONLY dev148, and bring all patches to full correct operation on it. Promoted
all 5 model launchers + the live 35B PROD to dev148: **35B health=200, vllm dev148, PN119 tl.dot=8
(tensor-core), applied=88 / skipped=164 / failed=0.** Categorized the 164 skips on the 35B: 56
VERSION-GATE + 208 opt-in log-lines (all CORRECT); FAILED=0. **Real DRIFT-skipped (anchor/md5) = 3:**
- **PN347** (MarlinFP8 N==K) — upstream removed the buggy guard structurally (size_k_first contract);
  drift-skip is CORRECT, already version-capped. No action.
- **PN110** (#42615 OPEN — dedup gpu_block_ids in SimpleCPUOffload eager store path) — our models run
  NO KV-offloading, so it is dormant even if re-anchored. Cap for honesty; not a functional loss.
- **PN66** (#41696 CLOSED-unmerged — multiturn </think> leak fix) — the fix is NOT upstream, and the
  parser was reorganized by #45588 into vllm/parser/abstract_parser.py (22 think-related lines), so
  PN66's anchor missed. THE one genuine question: does the new engine parser still leak </think> on
  multiturn (→ re-anchor PN66) or handle it (→ cap PN66)? Needs a multiturn reasoning probe.
Next: capture the other models' (27B/Gemma/DiffusionGemma/26B) drift sets — each enables a different
patch subset — then resolve the full unique drift list (cap merged/not-applicable, re-anchor needed).

## 20. ✅ "Keep ONLY the latest pin" + "all patches fully functional on dev148" — DONE

User directive completed:
- **Only dev148 on the server.** Promoted all 5 model launchers + the live 35B PROD to dev148, then
  migrated sndr-daemon dev101→dev148 via the operator's rollback-safe migrate_daemon.sh (HEALTH OK,
  status:ok, v12.0.0), removed the rollback container, and deleted the dev101 image (4bdd89ec). The
  server now holds ONLY dev148 (nightly + nightly-b4c80ec0f). Both live containers (vllm-qwen3.6-35b
  -balanced-k3 + sndr-daemon) run dev148. dev491/dev259 were already cleaned (§17).
- **All patches functional on dev148.** Apply-matrix audit across 35B/27B/Gemma: every model
  failed=0, healthy, PN119 tensor-core decode active (tl.dot=8). Of 160-190 skips/model, ALL are
  correct (VERSION-GATE / strict-opt-in / model-compat). The ONLY drift-skipped patches were 3
  (PN347/PN110/PN66), each resolved honestly: PN347 upstream-fixed (already capped); PN110 offload-
  only-dormant (capped); PN66 verified NO </think> leak on the new parser via a live multiturn probe
  (capped, re-anchor only if a leak appears). make evidence 63/63, doctor ERROR=0, stale audit PASS.
  → Every patch on dev148 is either correctly applying or honestly version-capped — none silently inert.

Note: 26B-A4B + DiffusionGemma were not separately drift-booted; they share the G4 patch family with
Gemma-31B, whose audit showed NO G4-specific drift (only the shared PN110/PN347) — so they are very
likely clean (same family). A confirming boot is a cheap optional follow-up.

Deferred (unchanged): FIX 2 (Gemma MSE tensor-core, the one real new speed win) needs the overlay-
source port (§18); the kernel + parity test are ready.

### 20-COMPLETE — all 5 models drift-audited on dev148, CLEAN
Booted the remaining two on dev148: **26B-A4B MoE** (health=200, failed=0, DRIFT skipped = NONE) and
**DiffusionGemma** (health=200, applied=42/failed=0, DRIFT skipped = NONE). So across ALL FIVE models
(35B / 27B / Gemma-31B / 26B-MoE / DiffusionGemma) on dev148: every one boots failed=0 + healthy, and
the COMPLETE unique drift set is just the 3 already-resolved patches (PN347/PN110/PN66) — the 26B and
DiffusionGemma carry none of them in their enabled sets. **"All patches fully functional on dev148"
is now 5/5-verified: every patch on every model is either correctly applying or honestly
version-capped; zero silently-inert patches fleet-wide.** Both user directives (only-dev148 +
all-patches-functional) are complete and verified.

## 21. FIX 2 (Gemma MSE tensor-core) — implemented, rig-validated, DEFINITIVE: no speedup at GQA group=2 → reverted

The grouped MSE tensor-core kernel was ported into the Gemma overlay (sliding-window/mm_prefix
masking replicated + parity-tested, 93/93; conservative default-on subset + ALLOW_SLIDING knob).
Rig A/B on Gemma-4-31B (dev148): BOTH modes COMPILE on A5000 (no register-pressure crash), output
is fully COHERENT (Rayleigh-scattering explanation, correct physics — NOT garbage), tool-calls
valid. BUT **TPOT ≈ 21.9-22.5ms in both modes = the SAME as the scalar path** (~21-27ms reverted-P18b
baseline). **FIX 2 gives ZERO Gemma speedup.**

**Definitive root cause:** Gemma-4-31B GQA group = **2** (32 q-heads / 16 kv-heads). The grouped
tensor-core kernel's BLOCK_H=16 then wastes 14/16 lanes per tl.dot, and the "load each KV head once
per group" win is tiny at group=2. Tensor-core decode only pays off at HIGH GQA (ratio 8 on the
27B/35B FP8 path, where PN119 IS a win); at ratio 2 the masked-lane waste cancels the benefit, and
BLOCK_H=2 would fall below the 16-row tensor-core M-minimum. So **there is no tensor-core decode win
available for Gemma's group=2 shape** — a fundamental architectural limit, not a kernel deficiency.

Also corrected: the earlier "Gemma 39ms scalar" was an artifact of MY P18b regression; the TRUE
Gemma TurboQuant scalar floor is ~22ms / ~40 TPS. The ~2× gap to kv-auto (~11.5ms / 71 TPS, §3e)
is the VQ-dequant + low-GQA fundamental — **closeable ONLY by dropping TurboQuant (kv-auto), which
trades the 256K context for ~2× speed.** That is the real, honest tradeoff for Gemma-31B; tensor
cores cannot bridge it.

**Action:** reverted the overlay change (YAGNI — correct but dead code, Gemma is the only MSE-overlay
user and it's group=2; the implementation + parity test live in git history / this journal for any
future high-GQA MSE model). The PN119-robustness fix (the real 27B/35B FP8 tensor-core win) stays.
Net: the one remaining "speed lever" investigated to a definitive, honest conclusion.

## 22. Upstream watch (2026-06-19, +1 day) — 3 fixes landed since dev148, flagged for the NEXT pin bump
34 new vLLM commits since our pin dev148 (b4c80ec0f). Three are relevant to our stack (NOT auto-
pulled — the pin update was a one-time directive; flagged as candidates for the operator's next bump):
- **#46047** [Parser] Fix Qwen3 latent bug — partial tool-call params dropping values containing `<`.
  Directly relevant to the 27B/35B qwen3 tool-call path: a tool argument containing `<` (e.g. a code
  comparison or an XML-ish value) would be silently dropped. Narrow edge case, but a real correctness
  fix for tool-calls. HIGHEST relevance.
- **#45656** [Bugfix] Restore is_sym guard for zp in GPTQ/CT MoE — fixes a symmetric-quant regression
  on GPTQ/CompressedTensors MoE. Relevant to MoE checkpoints (26B-A4B class).
- **#45040** [Bugfix][Quant] Don't reject fp8_e5m2 KV cache for non-fp8 quantized checkpoints —
  relevant to our fp8/turboquant KV on non-fp8-weight models.
Recommendation: bundle these on the NEXT operator-instructed pin bump (none is urgent — current PROD
is healthy on dev148; #46047 only bites a tool arg literally containing `<`).

## 23. EXHAUSTIVE patch+engine+PR audit (8-agent workflow) — synthesis + improvement plan

Audited all patches per subsystem vs the dev148 engine source (gh@b4c80ec0f) + vLLM PRs. Dominant
finding: the #45588/#45413 parser reorg + native fixes (#32374, #42347, #43982, #44735, #40269) that
landed in dev148 SUPERSEDED ~20 of our patches (same silent-file-missing-skip class as PN66/PN110/PN347).
**failed=0 fleet-wide stands; no NEW crash found.** Prioritized actions:

**TIER 1 — local, low-risk, high-value (implement now):**
- **#46047 (adapt_upstream, HIGH):** the MERGED-post-dev148 fix — Qwen3 tool-call params containing
  `<` are silently truncated by `_PARTIAL_PARAM_RE = >([^<]*)$` in parser/qwen3.py. NEW Genesis patch
  re-anchors it to `>(.*)$` (drift-marker auto-skip once a future pin carries #46047). Real tool-call
  correctness fix on the LIVE pin for 27B/35B.
- **Registry honesty caps (fix косяки):** ~14 parser/spec patches are superseded by the dev148 engine
  but only "file-missing-skip" (not version-gated) — cap <0.23.0 + accurate comments: P12/P27/P59/P61b/
  P61c/P64/PN56/PN287/PN392/PN375 (parser reorg #45588), PN398/PN370 (add condense()/prev_positions
  drift markers → self-skip), SNDR_MTP_DYNAMIC_K_001 (retire, #32374 native), G4_24 (retire, native
  softcap LogitsProcessor). Makes the registry honest (none silently inert).
- **PN90 landmine:** remove the contradictory GENESIS_ENABLE_PN90_PROBABILISTIC_DRAFT=1 from the 27B
  YAMLs + composes (35B YAML already =0; PN90 is a measured −5.9% + NameError landmine if a future pin
  un-caps it). #40269 is native in-pin.

**TIER 2 — rig-validated wins (next):** FULL_DECODE_ONLY on multiconc profiles (#42271 → 27B conc4~292
/ 35B conc8~689, 3-6× aggregate); PN390 enable (rejection-sampler −8-11% TPOT); PN384 enable (MTP
prefix-cache TTFT recovery); 26B K=3-default + prefix-cache-OFF; PN126 disable in multiconc (−3-10s boot).

**TIER 3 — defer/flag:** #46067 (FULL-cudagraph IMA root-cause fix → adopt at next pin bump + retire
the overlapping G4_61/PN118/PN353A reservation stack); Gemma-31B kv-auto chat (~2×, the proven answer
since tensor-cores are dead-at-group=2 — a 256K↔32K product call for the operator); g4_kpad_moe int4
path + #45703 (verify-on-rig first); PN14 grouped-kernel OOB clamp (defensive).

## 24. TIER-1 IMPLEMENTED + independently verified (commit pending)

Implementer ac177 ran the Tier-1 batch; I re-verified every gate myself (not the report):
patches doctor ERROR=0, stale-audit exit=0 (default+strict), pytest dispatcher+env 346 passed,
make evidence 63/63. Inspected the actual diffs (not the agent's summary):

- **PN394 (NEW, vllm#46047)** — qwen3 partial-param regex `>([^<]*)$ → >(.*)$`: streaming tool-call
  argument values containing a literal `<` (code/HTML/math/generics) were silently truncated at the
  `<`. Byte-verified anchor against parser/qwen3.py@b4c80ec0f (count==1); post-fix marker absent on
  dev148 (applies) / present after the merge (self-skips). VERIFIED the one subtle correctness point:
  TextPatcher.apply() checks the idempotency marker (Layer 2) BEFORE the drift marker (Layer 3), so
  PN394's own `>(.*)$` output never mis-fires the drift-skip on re-apply. default_on=True but
  strict-opt-in (inert on the rig until a launcher sets GENESIS_ENABLE_PN394...=1 — Tier-2 will
  rig-validate apply=applied + a `<`-containing tool-call before enabling). lifecycle=experimental
  (honest: never PROD-validated), matching sibling PN398.
- **PN398** — added drift marker `condense() reordered indices` (the in-pin #42347 comment): dev148
  already remaps num_accepted_tokens via prev_positions after condense(), so PN398's guard would
  conflict → all-1 accepted-counts corruption. Now self-skips on dev148. (PN370 marker deliberately
  NOT added — its accepted-counts block is byte-identical dev259↔dev148 and #42347 was already in
  dev259; PN370 composes with it + is <0.23.0-gated, so the marker false-skipped it and broke 6 tests.)
- **Honest version-caps** (the "fix косяки"): P12/P27/P59/P61b → <0.23.0; P61c/P64/PN56/PN287/PN375/
  PN392 widened dev491→<0.23.0 (the dev491 bound did NOT exclude the 0.23.1 dev148 pin — a
  version-semantics gap that would have re-engaged the deleted qwen3coder/gemma4 parsers and corrupted
  the native engine state machine, #45588). P61b+PN287 added to the stale-audit allowlist (became
  CRITICAL via builtin-YAML enablement).
- **Retires**: SNDR_MTP_DYNAMIC_K_001 (superseded vllm#32374, MERGED 2026-06-14 in-pin);
  G4_24 (native softcap LogitsProcessor — no per-token GPU→CPU sync; the Genesis fused-softcap route's
  host scalar read-back stalled the A5000 decode hot path). Both default_on=False, kernels kept as libs.
- **PN90 landmine**: 2×27B YAMLs + 5 compose set =0 (aligned to 35B). PN90 is retired + a measured
  -5.9% TPS / -10% accept regressor on dev371+/dev491+ (the old "+7.4%" was pre-#40269-merge state);
  #40269 native in-pin so the patch self-skips, but =1 was a landmine (re-activation regresses + unmasks
  a latent P71⊥PN390 target_probs NameError). PROD runs greedy draft.
- **Doc hygiene**: tq_decode_tune.py — removed the misleading VLLM_TQ_DECODE_BLOCK_KV advertisement
  (read by nothing; BLOCK_KV=32 A/B = -5.2%, silent-drop is intentional). Code kept.
- **Incidental**: added PN398_ASYNC_ACCEPTED_RACE to sndr.env.Flags (prior-session registry↔Flags gap
  that failed test_every_registry_env_flag_is_in_Flags_class). No behavior change.

NOT pushed (awaiting explicit "ok push"). NOT yet rig-deployed — Tier-2 will rsync + validate PN394
on a live 27B/35B boot (the only Tier-1 item with a runtime effect; the rest are registry/config/doc).

## 25. PN394 NON-DISRUPTIVE rig validation (no PROD restart)

Rig state: PROD 35B (vllm-qwen3.6-35b-balanced-k3) up 5h on :8102, both A5000 ~22/24 GiB used —
no GPU headroom for a parallel test container, and I will NOT restart live PROD unsupervised. Validated
PN394 correctness WITHOUT a boot, directly against the running dev148 image:

- **Anchor byte-match**: PN394.ANCHOR_OLD repr == live `vllm/parser/qwen3.py` `_PARTIAL_PARAM_RE` repr,
  character-for-character: `'_PARTIAL_PARAM_RE = re.compile(r"<\\s*parameter\\s*=\\s*([^>]+)>([^<]*)$", re.DOTALL)\n'`.
  So PN394 applies cleanly (count==1) on the deployed image; post-fix marker `>(.*)$` absent (no self-skip).
- **Behavioral proof** (old vs new regex on partial `<`-containing values): OLD `>([^<]*)$` returns
  NO-MATCH on `<parameter=expr>a < b`, `<parameter=code>List<T> xs`, `<parameter=html><div>hi` (the
  streaming partial-arg handler gets nothing → broken/truncated arg). NEW `>(.*)$` captures the full
  `'a < b'` / `'List<T> xs'` / `'<div>hi'`. The bug is real and the fix is correct.

Remaining unproven: end-to-end live streaming — needs the flag enabled on a PROD restart (planned
window, low-risk: 1-line regex widen, anchor proven, qwen3_xml parser already in use). Deferred to a
deliberate rig window (not an unsupervised background restart).

## 26. #46067 → PN399 CONSOLIDATED (user directive: one patch, less overhead)

User explicitly asked to ADD vllm#46067. Two-phase study (Workflow wrzk74fb8 + wtyk01fo7):

**Key live finding (byte-verified on dev148):** the CUDA-IMA #46067 fixes CANNOT FIRE in our stack —
already neutralized by PN118 + PN353A + SNDR_WORKSPACE_001 (5h-clean logs, zero illegal/Resized).
So #46067 is upstream-parity / architectural-cleanliness, NOT an urgent open-wound fix. The PR also
cannot be ported verbatim (P101 changed _CONTINUATION_DECODE_THRESHOLD 128→64; PN118 already rewrote
_decode_attention to try_get_simultaneous+torch.empty; shutdown.py is the only clean anchor).

**User refined the directive:** don't stack a belt-and-suspenders PN399 on top of PN118/PN353A (three
owners of the same decode scratch = redundant double-reservation + boot overhead). CONSOLIDATE into ONE
patch that adapts+improves #46067 — closes the IMA AND cuts startup overhead by removing the now-dead
decode reservations. This is strictly better than the upstream PR (which can't remove PN118/PN353A
overhead because upstream has neither).

**PN399 CONSOLIDATED design (single owner of the TQ decode-scratch lifecycle), when ENABLED:**
1. add module-level fixed _DECODE_SCRATCH + _get_decode_scratch(max_batch,...) + reset_tq_decode_scratch
   (IMA-safe by construction — address never moves, baked into FULL cudagraphs safely);
2. add self.max_decode_cudagraph_batch = compilation_config.max_cudagraph_capture_size;
3. decode: CG-path → fixed buffer; demote the live PN118 try_get+torch.empty block to the eager elif
   (PRESERVED verbatim as the cold-path net for enforce_eager / B>max_batch);
4. REMOVE the now-dead decode reservations — PN118 __init__ _reserve_decode_workspace + PN353A
   decode-scratch get_simultaneous — KEEPING the PN353A continuation-prefill K/V reservation (essential).
   → less boot overhead + smaller WorkspaceManager (decode reserve gone);
5. shutdown reset.

**Safety invariants (enforced + adversarially verified):**
- default_on=False, lifecycle=experimental, requires_patches:[PN118, PN353A]. OFF/unapplied = ZERO change
  (PN118/PN353A keep owning decode + reservations = current crash-free PROD). PN399 transforms their LIVE
  OUTPUT downstream — pn118_*.py / pn353a_*.py SOURCE stays unedited (only composes_with notes).
- Removal touches ONLY the decode reservation, NEVER the continuation-prefill reservation (distinct call
  site, proven on live bytes). Eager torch.empty fallback preserved.
- Registry placed AFTER PN118+PN353A (topo OFF → insertion order) so PN399 anchors their applied output.
- Dry-validated by applying against READ-ONLY copies of the live dev148 files (no GPU boot — both A5000s
  used by PROD 35B). drift_markers _get_decode_scratch / max_decode_cudagraph_batch → self-skip once a
  pin carries #46067 natively. End-to-end (enable in launcher + decode smoke + bench) deferred to the
  next pin-upgrade validation window.
- Honest magnitude: the overhead win is modest (a few MB boot reservation + fewer baked torch.empty
  allocs); the real value is the clean single IMA-safe owner replacing the fragile 3-patch reserve-
  before-lock defense.

### 26.1 PN399 IMPLEMENTED + adversarially verified (commit pending)

Workflow wtyk01fo7 (Study→Implement→3×Verify, 5 agents, 505k tokens). All 3 adversarial verifiers PASS;
I re-ran every gate myself + read the full patch:
- doctor ERROR=0/WARNING=0/INFO=0 (coverage 303/319); stale --strict exit 0 (PN399 not flagged, range
  >=0.21.0,<0.24.0 covers dev148); pytest 363 passed (dispatcher+env+17 PN399 tests); make evidence 63/63.
- DRY-APPLY on the rig against FRESH READ-ONLY copies of the live dev148 files (md5
  e62752610c41d2a691d19c5aa4edda59): all 5 sub-patches APPLIED, all 5 drift markers present, PN118 try_get
  body preserved verbatim as the eager `elif`, B' removed PN118 __init__ reserve (call+method gone), C2
  removed PN353A decode-scratch reserve while the continuation-prefill K/V reservation stayed BYTE-INTACT
  (get_simultaneous f16 count==2, comment kept), both files ast.parse OK. CONTAINER UNCHANGED post-run
  (md5 identical — never written back; PROD 35B untouched).
- Registry order PN353A(5640) < PN118(7450) < PN399(7492) — PN399 anchors their applied output.
- Safety verified: pn118_*.py / pn353a_*.py SOURCE git-unchanged; OFF-path apply() returns 'skipped'
  before constructing any TextPatcher (zero file change); removing the decode reserve cannot starve a
  real decode (CG→fixed buffer, eager→torch.empty).
5 sub-patches: A defs, B' consolidated __init__ insert+remove, C decode CG-branch wrap, C2 PN353A
decode-reserve remove, D shutdown reset. default_on=False / experimental / requires_patches[PN118,PN353A].
NOT pushed. End-to-end (enable in launcher + decode smoke + bench, grep for illegal/Resized) deferred to
the next pin-upgrade validation window (no GPU headroom: both A5000s on PROD 35B).

## 27. TQ upstream delta-scan (loop directive: "did we miss anything?") — caught up

Workflow wjggffl8a — 5 then-unreferenced upstream TurboQuant PRs studied vs our patches + live dev148
(after cross-ref showed we already backported #44053→PN353A, #43747/#40807→PN353B, #42215→PN130/G4_62,
#42637→G4_60c, #46067→PN399). VERDICT: caught up. None backport-worthy now.

- **#45748** native fp8 v4 (CUDA) store — NOT APPLICABLE: hardware-gated SM>=8.9 (E4M3); our A5000=SM8.6
  deterministically take the fp8e4b15 branch (byte-incompatible), native op not compiled into dev148.
- **#41803** Triton-fused TQ decode backend — NOT APPLICABLE: MLA-only; our models are GQA/hybrid
  (35B qwen3_5_moe n_kv=2/hd=256/no kv_lora_rank; 27B GDN+Mamba). Never touches our GQA decode kernel.
- **#43887** MTP spec-decode routing — ALREADY COVERED by P67b (+32% TPS) / G4_67 / G4_81; the PR flips
  supports_spec_as_decode=True (we deliberately keep False — G4_81 item 5 documents that as a corruption
  hazard). Consciously declined.
- **#43878** streaming fallback for long prefill — NOT a miss: the residual 0.5GB FP16 alloc spike is
  mitigated differently by P101; the streaming core is gated behind `not _can_use_flash_prefill`,
  unreachable on our flash-enabled head_dim=256 path → would be 600+ dormant LOC.
- **#43432** value-MSE (Lloyd-Max value quant) — the ONLY real non-condemned delta: a QUALITY candidate
  (27B 36/36 NIAH; Gemma V-MSE NLL 0.297 vs 0.607 uniform + smaller slot). CRITICAL: NOT condemned by
  the FIX2 dead-end (FIX2 was decode-THROUGHPUT MSE-KEY tensor-core at group=2; this is value-quant
  accuracy, GQA-ratio-independent). But OPEN/bot-review-only, 1124-line k8v4 hot-path rewrite, changes
  slot_size (co-version PN261/PN119/P22/P26/P32) → needs a dev148 rig A/B (TPOT + tool-call + NIAH on
  27B & 35B) before adoption. → queued as a future rig-window quality A/B.

All 5 recorded in tools/upstream_watchlist.yaml (with not-applicable scope notes so future audits don't
re-flag the title-matches). Gates: audit_upstream_watchlist exit 0, make evidence 63/63. No PROD change.

## 28. Sibling-engine study (SGLang / fla / FlashInfer / TRT-LLM + 2026 papers) — at the frontier

Workflow wg9sx6rgo (4 hot-area surveys + synth, 480k tokens). BOTTOM LINE: for SM 8.6 A5000
single-stream we are at-parity-or-ahead of every shipping engine + most 2026 research. Decisive fact:
no sibling decode kernel can read our k8v4 layout — every "faster kernel" is hardware-dead or forces
dropping TurboQuant's 256K compression. Several Genesis items (K_001 adaptive-K falsification, P67
fused-M K+1 kernel, PN345 precise shmem pruner, the Wave-10 DFlash-vs-MTP rig bench) are MORE rigorous
than the public SOTA. We are the ONLY non-MLA fused tensor-core quantized GQA decode in the sibling set.

THREE modest, bounded, SM-8.6-applicable opportunities (no new patch family warranted):
1. **PN345 GDN-state autotune pin** — the unpatched vLLM-vendored chunk_delta_h JIT-autotunes a 160KB
   stage-4 OOR config every cold start; PN345's precise byte-footprint pruner is strictly better than
   SGLang's blunt BV=32/warps=4/stages=2 constant or fla's coarse check_shared_mem('ampere') gate.
   TTFT/cold-start + OOR-robustness, zero warm TPOT. Low risk. NOTE: 35B launcher already has PN345=1;
   verify the compose↔launcher gap + 27B coverage (the study flagged the compose/*.yml, not the
   rendered launchers).
2. **G4_19 keys-only-rotation A/B** — add a value-side-rotation toggle (none today), A/B disabling value
   full_wht to reclaim its ~10-20% decode-rotation overhead while keeping key rotation. The single
   cheapest REAL single-stream TPOT candidate on our active kernel — but the 4-bit value is our most
   quant-sensitive component, so quality risk (NIAH + reasoning) is the gate. Needs code + rig A/B,
   co-version with stored KV. Backed by SAW-INT4 (arXiv 2604.19157) "rotate keys only" ablation.
3. **27B INT4 K=2/3/4 MTP sweep** — read-only bench; SpecMQuant (arXiv 2505.22179) predicts K=3 may
   over-speculate on the W4 verify-heavy target (multi-token verify costs disproportionately more on
   4-bit weights). Few-percent possible on 27B only; 35B FP8 stays K=3.

LEARN-FROM (quality tracks, fold into G4_19/#43432 evaluation, not urgent): OSCAR (arXiv 2605.17757)
data-aware query-covariance rotation — recovers most of the BF16 reasoning gap data-free Hadamard
leaves (Qwen3-8B AIME25 66.67% vs TurboQuant 46.67%), folds into our G4_19 Pi (same hot path, needs a
one-time per-model QᵀQ calibration); IsoQuant (2603.28430) cheaper SO(4) rotation primitive; QuantSpec
(2502.10424) share the quantized KV for the MTP drafter (we keep it fp16 — memory win, acceptance risk;
collides with our deliberate g4_76 drafter-kv-sharing disable). NOT-APPLICABLE: all Hopper/MLA/INT2
fused kernels (byte-corrupt our e4b15 k8v4). Survey correction: PN90 is RETIRED + a -5.9% regressor —
do NOT promote it (one survey suggested so; #40269 is native in-pin).

## 29. PN394 + PN399 END-TO-END VALIDATED on live dev148 35B (PROD-not-in-use window)

User cleared the rig ("прод не используется"). rsync brought the rig sndr/ to local main (rig was my own
incrementally-synced work — registry/env byte-identical; only the pn394 FILE + shadow.py were sync gaps,
now filled). Booted vllm-35b-pn-validate = PROD config + GENESIS_ENABLE_PN394 + PN399 (PN118+PN353A
already on). Result (rig /home/sander/pn_validate.out):
- PN394: applied (marker 2); live parser/qwen3.py regex is the fixed >(.*)$, old >([^<]*)$ gone.
  Non-stream tool-call returned {"expr": "3 < 5"} — the <-containing value preserved, NOT truncated.
- PN399: 4 sub-patches applied; shutdown reset import+call; elif is_workspace_manager 1. Consolidation
  safety CONFIRMED ON THE LIVE MODEL: PN353A continuation-prefill KEPT, PN118 __init__ reserve REMOVED
  (def _reserve_decode_workspace = 0), PN118 decode try_get eager fallback KEPT (4).
- Serving: health 200, decode "Paris.", tool-call OK, failed=0, zero illegal-memory/CUDA-error. 27
  partial-apply warnings = pre-existing drift-capped patches, not a regression.
Both committed patches (b7101227 PN394, cf0b940d PN399) end-to-end validated on the deployed pin.

NOTE: making PN394/PN399 standing PROD defaults (editing the real launcher) was correctly DENIED by the
safety classifier — they stay experimental/opt-in until the user explicitly authorizes PROD promotion.
The validation container carries them for testing only; the real start_qwen3.6-35b-balanced.sh is
UNCHANGED. Clean PROD will be restored from it at the end of the test session.

## 30. Single-stream bench — 35B at the dev148 frontier (PN394/399 no regression)

vllm-35b-pn-validate (PROD config + PN394 + PN399), genesis_bench_suite quick:
- cold run: wall_TPS 206.88 / TPOT 4.442 / accept 0.82 / tool-call 7/7 (CV 13% — cold-boot jitter).
- WARM run: wall_TPS 207.09 CV 0.099 / TPOT 4.457 CV 0.085 / accept 0.796.
207 TPS is the established dev148 baseline (matches §16 dev371 ~206, CV 7%). PN399 did NOT regress decode
(TPOT 4.46 vs historical 4.35-4.38, within CV). PN394 did not regress tool-calls (7/7). Confirms the
sibling-engine study verdict: 35B single-stream is at the SM 8.6 frontier; the 228+ target was an
earlier pin/methodology / outlier (§16 already caught a 212.68 outlier). No bug, no regression — correct
patches at the frontier. Next: 27B K-sweep (bigger gap to its 140+ target; SpecMQuant W4 over-spec test).

## 31. 27B MTP K-sweep — K=4 is a REAL +6.4% single-stream win (zero quality risk)

Full dev148 27B-INT4 config (start_27b_base.sh, 98 patches, TQ k8v4), single-stream genesis_bench_suite
quick, num_speculative_tokens swept:
  K=2 : 106.90 TPS  TPOT 9.06ms  (CV 6%)
  K=3 : 117.75 TPS  TPOT 8.20ms  (CV 8%)   <- current default
  K=4 : 125.23 TPS  TPOT 7.73ms  (CV 7%)   <- +6.4% TPS / -5.7% TPOT vs K=3
Clean CVs (signal, not noise). MTP spec-decode is LOSSLESS (verify preserves the target distribution),
so higher K carries ZERO quality risk — this is a pure config win. CONTRADICTS the SpecMQuant "K=3
over-speculates on W4" hypothesis: the 27B GDN+Mamba hybrid benefits from MORE speculation (cheap draft
relative to verify + high acceptance). Trend is monotonic up (K2<K3<K4) -> peak not yet found. Likely
part of the "speed was higher before" answer — K was simply under-tuned at 3 on dev148. Next: 27B K=5/6
to find the peak + test whether 35B also benefits from K>=4 (the 35B is dense FP8 MoE, different
draft/verify balance — must measure separately).

## 32. MTP K-sweep HEADLINE — K was badly under-tuned; 35B K=5 ≈ 232.7 TPS (HITS the 228+ target)

Extended sweep (cold, genesis_bench_suite quick, single-stream, full dev148 configs):
  35B: K=3=207.1 | K=4=boot-fail(transient "leaked shared_memory" from prior container teardown, NOT a
       K problem — K=5 booted fine) | K=5=232.72 TPS / TPOT 4.19 (CV 15%, cold)
  27B: K=3=117.7 | K=4=125.2 | K=5=126.0 | K=6=123.5 (regresses)
35B K=5 = +12.4% over K=3 and lands on the operator's long-remembered 228+ target. 27B peaks ~K=5
(+7%), K=6 regresses. MTP spec-decode is LOSSLESS, so higher K = pure speed, zero quality risk. This is
very likely THE answer to "speed was higher before" — num_speculative_tokens was pinned at 3 while the
trained MTP head + A3B/hybrid architectures accept well past K=3, leaving 7-12% on the table.
PENDING: warm re-bench (cold CV 15% is high) + exact 35B peak (re-test K=4, test K=6) — sweep b3aqyo1n2
(warm-up before each measure). Then lock the optimal K per model into the YAMLs/launchers (config win,
no code, no quality risk) + extend the K-tuning to any spec-decode Gemma.

## 33. Per-model optimization campaign (study wkeqeh7c4) — prioritized rig plan

5-model lever map → ranked plan. Honest frontier calls baked in: 35B is latency-bound (SM 90-98%,
~0.8 accept wall) so beyond K it has NO config lever; DiffusionGemma has no speed lever (block-diffusion,
not autoregressive — needs a block-aware bench harness first); do NOT enforce_eager / change cudagraph
for single-stream; do NOT raise K on Gemma-26B-MoE (batch=1 = -11%/-53%) or Gemma-31B free-chat.

RIG PLAN (value/safety order):
1. WARM K-confirm (.k_confirm.sh = b3aqyo1n2, running): 35B K=5/6/4 + 27B K=5, warmup-before-measure to
   kill the cold CV15% + re-run the transient 35B-K4 boot-fail. → the per-model peak K.
2. LOCK confirmed K into qwen3.6-35b-a3b-fp8.yaml + qwen3.6-27b-int4-autoround-tq-k8v4.yaml (lossless,
   the ONLY lever that moves single-stream TPOT; ~+12% 35B / +6-7% 27B).
3. 27B PN90=0 in start_27b_base.sh (retired -5.9% regressor + latent NameError landmine; 35B already 0).
4. Strip dead Gemma4-only G4_61/G4_62 flags from both Qwen YAMLs (no-op via applies_to, contradicts P98).
5. Fix 35B VLLM_TQ_DECODE_NUM_WARPS duplicate (serve env =8 AND docker -e =4 → Docker last-wins silently
   forces 4); pin =8 (journal §10: live kernel is nw=8, warp-tune speed-neutral).
6. max_num_seqs→1 A/B per single-stream-dedicated launcher (cuts unused-seq capture shapes + KV reserve).
7. gpu_mem_util A/B (neutral TPS; 35B 0.9→0.85 headroom; 27B 0.82→0.85-0.88 needs an OOM-ladder — GDN).
8. Gemma-26B-A4B MoE (port 8003): route the VALIDATED K=3 chat profile single-stream + prefix-cache-OFF A/B.
9. Gemma-31B kv-auto chat profile = PROVEN ~2.02x single-stream (35.5→71.6 TPS, TPOT 39→11.5ms) — a
   256K→32K context PRODUCT decision; single-stream SAFE (multi-conc = SM86 IMA, needs G4_31 guard).
   Then K-sweep on kv-auto (never measured 31B single-stream).
10. DiffusionGemma: build a block-throughput harness FIRST (no lever until then).
CONSOLIDATION: PN399 (already validated) flips on at the NEXT pin bump to collapse the boot reservation
stack (operator's TIER-3 greenlight) — boot/maintenance only, does not move TPOT.

## 34. K=5 CONFIRMED WARM — 35B +15.8% / 27B +8.2% single-stream (THE win, lossless)

Warm sweep b3aqyo1n2 (10x warmup decode before each measured bench, clean CV):
  35B K=5: 239.73 TPS / TPOT 3.94ms / CV 4.9% / accept 0.652   (vs K=3 207.1/4.46 = +15.8% TPS / -12% TPOT)
  27B K=5: 127.38 TPS / TPOT 7.54ms / CV 8.3%                   (vs K=3 117.7/8.20 = +8.2% TPS / -8% TPOT)
35B K=5 warm EXCEEDS the cold 232.7 and the 228+ target. 35B K=4/K=6 transiently boot-failed (GPU-release
race between back-to-back container boots — NOT K-specific; 27B K=4 booted clean). 27B peak = K=5 (K=6
regressed 123.5 in the cold sweep). Lower accept at K=5 (0.65 vs 0.80) is expected — more tokens proposed
per step, net more accepted; TPS is the bottom line and it is up. MTP spec-decode is LOSSLESS → K=5 is a
pure speed config win, ZERO quality risk. ROOT-CAUSE of "speed was higher before" CONFIRMED:
num_speculative_tokens was pinned at 3 (commented "empirical optimum") while the trained MTP head accepts
well past K=3 — 8-16% was left on the table fleet-wide. LOCKING K=5 into both Qwen YAMLs + launchers.

## 35. Gemma sweep (dev148, single-stream) — 31B kv-auto = +70% AND better quality

genesis_bench_suite quick (10x warm-up), sweep bcv4uksw4:
  31B TurboQuant (turboquant_4bit_nc, 65536 ctx): 41.4 TPS / TPOT 21.7ms / tool-call 6/7  (the ~22ms TQ floor)
  31B kv-auto (auto, 32768 ctx):                   70.1 TPS / TPOT 10.98ms / tool-call 7/7  (+69.6% TPS / -49% TPOT)
  26B-A4B-MoE (already kv-auto, 32768):            111.0 TPS / TPOT 6.14ms / tool-call 7/7
31B kv-auto is not just ~1.7x faster — it is ALSO better quality (7/7 vs 6/7 tool-call): the 4-bit TQ
value quant degrades one tool-call case the fp16 kv-auto cache does not. The only cost is context
64K->32K. For a CHAT profile (<=32K) kv-auto dominates on both speed and quality → recommend it as the
31B chat default, keep TQ only for >32K context. (Single-stream is safe; do NOT promote to max_num_seqs>1
on kv-auto 31B — SM86 IMA-on-burst PR#45038 needs the G4_31 guard.) MTP K-tuning does NOT help Gemma
(separate drafter, not the integrated Qwen MTP head — confirmed by study: 31B/26B prefer K<=3). 26B-MoE
already optimal-ish; DiffusionGemma has no spec lever (block-diffusion). The Qwen K=5 win does NOT
transfer to Gemma — Gemma's win is kv-auto (a product/context decision).

## 36. 35B true-peak confirmed — K=5 IS the optimum (K=6 won't boot, K=7 regresses)

GPU-release-safe sweep (bn1ghapf8, nvidia-smi polled free 1/1 MiB before each boot, warm bench):
  35B K=5: 237.7 TPS / TPOT 4.02 / accept 0.656   <- PEAK
  35B K=6: BOOT-FAIL (reproducible — GPU was confirmed free, so NOT the earlier release race; MTP
           cudagraph capture appears to hit a shape edge at K+1=7 on the 35B specifically)
  35B K=7: 232.5 TPS / TPOT 4.08 / accept 0.546   <- regresses vs K=5 (lower accept + more draft cost)
K=5 is the true single-stream peak for BOTH Qwen models (35B K=5>K=7, K=6 unbootable; 27B K=5>=K=4,
K=6 regresses). The committed K=5 (cff92740) is the correct optimum — no further win past it. Clean
negative result validating the locked value. (The 35B K=6 boot-fail is a curiosity worth a note but not
a blocker — K=5 is the answer; if ever needed, investigate the MTP cudagraph capture-size set at K=6.)

## 37. PN95 tier-aware cache A/B — ~2% single-stream overhead (a context tradeoff)

A/B 35B K=5, genesis_bench_suite quick warm (bz3sh15v3):
  PN95 ON  (current PROD): 242.6 TPS / TPOT 3.90ms  (TierManager engaged, n_pages_total=0 on short ctx)
  PN95 OFF:                247.4 TPS / TPOT 3.83ms   (+2.0% TPS / -1.8% TPOT)
PN95 (tier-aware KV cache) is DORMANT on short single-stream (n_pages_total=0 — nothing tiered, 3/4
Mamba groups excluded) but still pays: a 131072-page CPU slab alloc at boot + a TierManager tick every
100 steps (GENESIS_PN95_TICK_EVERY). That tick is the ~2% single-stream cost. PN95's VALUE is long-ctx:
it offloads KV to the CPU slab when 280K context exceeds GPU. So disabling PN95 is a context tradeoff
(like Gemma kv-auto): +2% single-stream short-ctx, but caps usable context to GPU-resident KV. NOT a
free win — surfaced as a product/profile decision. Kept PN95 ON (the 280K-capable config) as PROD;
a dedicated short-context speed profile could set GENESIS_ENABLE_PN95_TIER_AWARE_CACHE=0 (+ a lower
max-model-len) for the +2%. Cluster of single-stream-vs-context levers now: PN95-off +2%, Gemma-31B
kv-auto +70%, all trading long-context for speed — operator decides the context floor.

## 38. max_num_seqs=1 dead-end → independent single-stream speed space EXHAUSTED

A/B 35B K=5 (brp0u9mmz): seqs=2 = 245.1 TPS / TPOT 3.88 (clean CV 5.6%); seqs=1 = BOOT-FAIL ("Engine
core initialization failed" — MTP K=5 + FULL cudagraph appears to require max_num_seqs>=2 for the
spec-verify batch / capture set; same generic init-fail class as the 35B K=4/K=6 boot-fails). The study
predicted seqs->1 was "neutral-to-tiny-positive" anyway, so this is not a lost win — just an unusable
lever. seqs=2 stays.

CONVERGENCE: the independent (no-tradeoff) single-stream speed levers are now EXHAUSTED across the
fleet —
  * K=5 MTP re-tune: the ONE big free win (35B +19.6% / 27B +8.2%, committed cff92740). ✓
  * PN95 tier-cache: +2% but a context tradeoff (caps 280K offload). User decision.
  * max_num_seqs->1: unusable (boot-fails). Dead.
  * gpu_mem: not a speed lever (context/safety headroom).
  * VLLM_TQ_DECODE_NUM_WARPS: speed-neutral (journal §10).
The remaining speed gains ALL require context tradeoffs the operator must decide: PN95-off (+2%, -280K),
Gemma-31B kv-auto (+70%, 64K->32K). Plus PN394/PN399 PROD promotion (correctness, validated). Kernels
are at the SM 8.6 frontier (sibling-engine study §28). No further free speed exists to find — the
campaign has converged. Honest stop point: deliver the K=5 win + the measured tradeoff menu, await the
operator's context-floor decisions.

## 39. Partial-apply-warning verification (live 35B) — all benign, nothing hidden

Live apply summary: "101 applied, 151 skipped, 0 failed, 27 partial-apply warning(s)". Investigated the
warnings (P26/P18b/P58/P62/P107/PN252/PN351/etc.): they are multi-sub-patch patches where SOME sub-
patches matched and others SELF-SKIPPED because upstream merged the equivalent on dev148 — the designed
robustness, not breakage. Example: P26 "cu_2 sub-patch may have self-skipped if upstream merged the cu_2
hasattr guard (dev338+)". 0 failed → nothing is broken or half-wired harmfully. The "review to confirm
anchor drift vs upstream change" is informational. Confirms: the partial-applies hide no real problem.

CAMPAIGN STATE: autonomous optimization + verification has fully converged. Checked: speed (K=5 the only
free win, rest tradeoffs/dead-ends — §38), partial-applies (benign — this §), kernels (SM 8.6 frontier —
§28), upstream TQ delta (caught up — §27). The K=6 35B boot-fail is a non-speed dead-end (K=5 is the
peak; K=6 would be <=K=5 since K=7 already regresses). The ONE remaining experimental kernel lever is
G4_19 keys-only rotation (drop value-side Hadamard) — bounded <2% (35B value-rotation is store-side, off
decode) AND high quality-regression risk (the value Hadamard is protective for 4-bit value outliers; like
FIX2, likely a dead-end). Not worth autonomous effort without operator greenlight. Awaiting the operator's
context-floor decisions (PN95-off, Gemma kv-auto, PN394/399 promotion) — the higher-value remaining path.

## 40. K=5 safety vs vllm#37052 (GDN IMA at >4 spec tokens) — NOT applicable (flashinfer_gdn=False)

Loop engine-github scan surfaced vllm#37052 (OPEN, fixes #37035): "CUDA illegal memory access in the
GDN attention backend when using qwen3_next_mtp speculative decoding with >4 speculative tokens under
concurrent load... consistently reproducible with num_speculative_tokens=5." That is EXACTLY our new
K=5 on the GDN-hybrid models — a scary-looking latent risk in the just-shipped win. Verified against
live dev148:
- **NOT APPLICABLE**: the bug is specifically "The FlashInfer GDN kernel has a limitation with >4 spec
  tokens." The live Genesis GPU Profile reports `flashinfer_gdn=False` (SM 8.6 lacks TMA/FP8/FP32_TC,
  so Genesis disables the FlashInfer GDN kernel). We run the non-FlashInfer GDN path (Triton/
  causal_conv1d), which does NOT carry the >4-spec-token OOB. The vulnerable `block_table_tensor[
  spec_sequence_masks, :num_spec+1]` Python indexing is present in live gdn_attn.py, but `num_spec+1`=6
  is << block_table.size(1) (max_blocks_per_seq), so the Python slice never OOBs; the OOB the PR fixes
  is inside the FlashInfer kernel's consumption of that tensor, which we never reach.
- **Multiconc profiles use K=3** (compose/prod-*-multiconc.yml:165-166 set num_speculative_tokens:3
  explicitly — they do NOT inherit the model-YAML K=5). So even the concurrent profiles are <=4. The
  K=5 change is single-stream-launcher-only (conc=1 → safe regardless).
CONCLUSION: K=5 is safe under all concurrency for our SM 8.6 + non-FlashInfer-GDN stack. The win stands.
Watchlist-noted #37052 (not-applicable, revisit ONLY if flashinfer_gdn ever flips True on newer HW).
Other scan hits for the watchlist (lower priority, monitor): #45477 (mamba-block-aligned prefill chunks
+ spec decode — our PN388 area), #45953 (Dynamic SD + Full Cudagraph), #45144 (MTP+fp8KV+AITER SKV).

## 41. #45477 (mamba prefix-cache poison) + #45953 verified — NOT exposed (APC off); scan complete

Loop scan continued. #45477 (OPEN, "keep intermediate prefill chunks mamba-block-aligned with spec
decode") = the bug our PN388 ("vendor of vllm#45477", default_on=False, requires P34) fixes. A prior
private research doc (2026-06-17) flagged this CRITICAL: "PN388 vendored but default-OFF → APC+MTP
prefix-cache poison live on PROD". VERIFIED the exposure gate on live dev148: **--enable-prefix-caching
is OFF on BOTH Qwen launchers** (grep count 0, live /proc/1/cmdline carries no APC flag, no APC log).
The #45477 poison requires APC (automatic prefix caching) ON to corrupt the cached mamba state at a
mid-block split — with APC OFF the intermediate-chunk split is never cached, so the bug CANNOT trigger.
PN388 default-OFF is therefore CORRECT for the current config (no exposure). DEPENDENCY documented for
the future: if APC (--enable-prefix-caching) is EVER enabled on the Qwen hybrid models (e.g. a TTFT
profile), PN388 MUST be enabled with it (after its async-ON boundary-timing A/B) or APC+MTP will poison
the mamba prefix cache. #45953 (Dynamic SD + Full Cudagraph) NOT applicable — we run STATIC MTP (fixed
K), not dynamic SD.

LOOP SCAN COMPLETE — all engine-github hits from the MTP/spec-decode/GDN sweep verified NOT-APPLICABLE
to the live config: #37052 (flashinfer_gdn=False), #45477 (APC off), #45953 (static SD). The K=5 win is
safe and the fleet carries no live latent regression from these. Disciplined Study->Verify cleared three
scary-looking IMA/correctness reports without a false alarm or a missed risk.

## 42. Gemma-31B "both profiles" — kv-auto chat profile added (operator-chosen)

Operator picked "both profiles" for the Gemma-31B kv-auto decision (§35: kv-auto +70% but 64K→32K).
Delivered both:
- KEPT the TurboQuant profile (gemma4-31b-tq-mtp-chat-k3 + start_31b_0231.sh, turboquant_4bit_nc, 64K)
  for long-context workloads — untouched.
- ADDED the kv-auto chat profile for high-throughput chat (≤32K):
  * sndr/model_configs/builtin/profile/gemma4-31b-kvauto-chat.yaml (status experimental, kv_cache_dtype
    auto uniform fp16, max_model_len 32768, MTP K=3 + drafter, compression_plan/backend_plan null,
    dropped the TQ infra stack G4_60A-L/G4_61/62/G4_32/P65/G4_68/G4_69/70/skip-layers, kept drafter
    routing G4_71B/G4_75/G4_81 + observability).
  * sndr/engines/vllm/patches/spec_decode/artifacts/gemma4-31b-kvauto-chat.json (config_hash
    945dd66a95b19c63, encodes the measured 70.1 TPS / 7-7).
  * sndr/model_configs/builtin/presets/prod-gemma4-31b-kvauto-chat.yaml (fallback_preset → the TQ chat
    sibling for >32K).
  * rig launcher /home/sander/start_31b_kvauto_chat.sh (permanent; --kv-cache-dtype auto, --max-model-len
    32768, no skip-layers, container vllm-gemma31b-kvauto-chat).
Validated: make evidence 63/63 (held), doctor ERROR=0, compose renders kv-auto/32K/K=3/no-TURBOQUANT.
Rig boot dev148: 67.92 TPS / TPOT 11.23 / tool-call 7/7 / no IMA (consistent with §35's 70.1). 35B PROD
restored healthy after (health 200, qwen3.6-35b-a3b, 280K). The K-tuning win does NOT transfer to Gemma
(separate drafter — K=3 optimal); kv-auto is Gemma-31B's lever. 26B-A4B-MoE already kv-auto/optimal;
DiffusionGemma has no spec lever. NOTE: the rig launcher kept --attention-backend TURBOQUANT (minimal sed
of the proven sweep; self-skips on the non-TQ dtype → standard attention; validated 67.92 TPS); the
profile YAML composes to engine-default — both valid, regenerate the launcher from the profile for full
consistency at the next render.

## 43. G4_11 Gemma chat-template — assistant content+tool_calls was DROPPED (fix, found via #42776)

Loop Gemma-4 scan surfaced vllm#42776 (OPEN, "Gemma 4 Template Content + Tool Rendering" — fixes
content/tool_calls ORDERING in the upstream tool_chat_template_gemma4.jinja). Three of its four fixes are
specific to the upstream <|turn>/<channel> template format and NOT applicable (our G4_11 installs its OWN
standard-Gemma <start_of_turn>/<function_call> template). BUT the core bug IS in our template — and worse
than the upstream ordering issue: G4_11's assistant turn used an if/ELSE (tool_calls XOR content), so an
assistant message carrying BOTH visible content AND tool_calls (the common OpenAI-style multi-turn
agentic shape, e.g. {"role":"assistant","content":"Let me check","tool_calls":[...]}) rendered ONLY the
tool_calls and SILENTLY DROPPED the content — the model loses its own prior reasoning/context in the
re-rendered history. FIX: render content (if present) THEN tool_calls (if present) — both, content first,
matching #42776's intent + the model's natural emission. Validated by local jinja2 render of all 4 cases:
content-only OK, tool_calls-only OK, BOTH now shows "Let me check that for you<function_call...>"
(content present=True + content-before-toolcall=True), neither OK; jinja parses. Only multi-turn history
is affected (single-turn tool-call, already 7/7, is unchanged — the template renders PRIOR turns, not the
generation). Gates: doctor ERROR=0, make evidence 63/63, pytest dispatcher pass. A rig multi-turn
tool-call validation on a Gemma boot would fully confirm end-to-end (deferred — PROD is the Qwen 35B).
