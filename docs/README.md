# `docs/` — Documentation Map

Public documentation for Genesis vLLM Patches. The top-level
`README.md` covers the headline project description; this folder
holds every operator-facing and contributor-facing reference.
Internal planning notes live in a gitignored sibling directory and
never ship publicly.

## File catalogue (50 markdown files)

### Onboarding & concepts

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md) | Two-minute orientation for newcomers — who it's for, what you get, the one install line, and where to go next. |
| [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Structural map of the codebase — three product surfaces over one core, repo tree walk, patch lifecycle data-flow, pin lifecycle, V2 config compose, bench/quality machinery, product-API seam. |
| [`LOCAL_AI_PRIMER.md`](LOCAL_AI_PRIMER.md) | Plain-English explainer of local AI — GPU/VRAM, inference engine, model size & MoE, quantization, tool-calling — and how SNDR Core fits. |
| [`COMPARISONS.md`](COMPARISONS.md) | Honest self-host-vs-cloud trade (cost-crossover shape) + SNDR Core vs other local engines. |
| [`FAQ.md`](FAQ.md) | Common operator questions (registry size, default-on subset, LoRA, streaming, `--from-running`, k8s/proxmox lifecycle). |

### Product surface (GUI / TUI / API / MCP)

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`GUI.md`](GUI.md) | The browser Control Center (`sndr up` → `http://127.0.0.1:8765`): screens, env vars, container/engine management, chat + Ops Copilot. |
| [`GUI_SECURITY.md`](GUI_SECURITY.md) | GUI daemon security model: bind/auth/2FA/OAuth, dangerous-actions matrix, endpoint list, hardening. |
| [`TUI.md`](TUI.md) | The terminal cockpit (`sndr tui`) — panes, keys, beginner mode, offline rig planning. |

| [`MCP.md`](MCP.md) | The MCP server (stdio JSON-RPC) exposing the Ops Copilot tool catalog to Claude Desktop / Cursor / IDE agents. |

### Run it — per machine (situation docs)

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`RUN_ON_LINUX.md`](RUN_ON_LINUX.md) | Full-stack front door for the Linux + CUDA + Docker box that runs the engine — warning-first, workload → preset → ctx → TPS → VRAM table, zero-decision `sndr quickstart`, expert paths preserved. |
| [`RUN_ON_MAC.md`](RUN_ON_MAC.md) | Honest Mac page — the engine can't run on a Mac; drive a Linux rig in client mode (CLI + GUI + memory) with the three-command remote path. |
| [`RUN_ON_WINDOWS_WSL.md`](RUN_ON_WINDOWS_WSL.md) | Windows, two honest lanes — WSL2 + NVIDIA passthrough (follow RUN_ON_LINUX) or client mode (no GPU); never a native-Windows engine. |
| [`REMOTE_ENGINE.md`](REMOTE_ENGINE.md) | Canonical client-mode reference — the `SNDR_OPENAI_BASE_URL` triplet, where each value comes from, CLI/GUI consumption, memory-DSN persistence, the `:8000` vs `:8102` port story, the `401` cause. |

### Installation & quickstart

| [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) | 5-minute setup path plus the 6-step Day-1 acceptance walkthrough. |
| [`HOST_SETUP.md`](HOST_SETUP.md) | The `~/.sndr/host.yaml` manual — every `paths:` key + env overrides, `sndr host` verbs, symbolic-mount verification, and the stale-`plugin_src` failure class (2026-07-04 incident). |
| [`OPERATIONS.md`](OPERATIONS.md) | Day-2 operations runbook — daily health checks, model swapping on shared GPUs, benching cadence, rollback recipes, log triage, GUI daemon lifecycle, disk hygiene. |

### Command + configuration reference

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`CLI_REFERENCE.md`](CLI_REFERENCE.md) | Complete `sndr` CLI surface, ordered by operator workflow. Cheatsheet at the top + per-subcommand reference with stability badges + detailed `sndr self-test` section. |
| [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) | Every Genesis env var — defaults, ranges, which patch reads it. |

## Subdirectories

| Folder | What's inside |
| --- | --- |
| [`img/`](img/) | Diagrams referenced from the narrative docs (DFlash vs MTP, patch impact, per-config perf). |
| [`assets/`](assets/) | Screenshots and other embedded assets (`assets/screenshots/`). |
| [`guides/`](guides/) | Focused guides: [`PIN_UPGRADE.md`](guides/PIN_UPGRADE.md) (pin-policy summary), [`COMMERCIAL_TIER.md`](guides/COMMERCIAL_TIER.md). |
| [`memory/`](memory/) | The persistent-memory engine manual ([`memory/MANUAL.md`](memory/MANUAL.md)). |
| [`design/`](design/) | Design documents (memory engine, neural-graph mode, persistent-memory architecture). |
| [`changelog/`](changelog/) | Per-release narrative changelogs (e.g. [`v12.0.0`](changelog/v12.0.0.md)). |
| [`_adr/`](_adr/) | Architecture decision records (multi-engine refactor, maturity remediation verdicts). |

The previous `reference/`, `security/`, `upstream/`, and
`upstream_refs/` subdirectories were retired in the 2026-05-16
consolidation pass:

- Historical experiment / deferred-work logs from 2026-04-27
  (`reference/`) were preserved in git history and removed from
  the public surface — they were operator-irrelevant snapshots.
- The Ed25519 trust-anchor ceremony (`security/`) was an internal
  artefact for a future license-tier that does not gate any
  public-core functionality.
- `upstream/STABLE_PROMOTION_CHECKLIST.md` was merged into
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Promoting a patch to `lifecycle=stable`"](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- `upstream/UPSTREAM_WATCHLIST.yaml` (consumed by
  `scripts/audit_upstream_watchlist.py`) moved to
  [`tools/upstream_watchlist.yaml`](../tools/upstream_watchlist.yaml)
  because it is a data file, not narrative documentation.
- `upstream/VLLM_PR_DECISION.md` was a historical 2026-04-26
  decision document preserved in git history.
- `upstream_refs/` (frozen vLLM source snapshots used as
  text-patch anchor references) was maintainer-side reference
  material with no operator-facing value; moved off the public
  tree entirely. Contributors authoring a new text-patch should
  pull upstream code directly via
  `git show vllm-project/vllm:<path>@<sha>` instead of reading
  pre-saved snapshots.

## Top-level repo docs (one folder up)

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`../README.md`](../README.md) | Project overview, quick install, hardware tested, architecture. |
| [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) | Per-version changelog (technical, deep — single source of truth). |
| [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) | Security policy + private disclosure email. |
| [`../LICENSE`](../LICENSE) | Apache-2.0. |

Contributor onboarding lives at [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) (this `docs/` folder, listed above).

## Auto-generated content

Two files are regenerated from canonical sources by CI gates:

- [`PATCHES_AUTO.md`](PATCHES_AUTO.md) —
  `python3 scripts/generate_patches_md.py`
- [`CONFIGS_AUTO.md`](CONFIGS_AUTO.md) —
  `python3 scripts/generate_configs_md.py`

Do not edit these by hand — the `--check` mode of each generator
gates pull requests. The matching narrative files
([`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md), [`CONFIGS.md`](CONFIGS.md)) capture
the explanations that don't fit in a machine-readable table.

## Consolidation history

The previous structure had 38 markdown files. After the 2026-05-16
consolidation pass, sibling topics were merged into single
operator-facing references so the surface matches industry-standard
docs/ layouts (vllm-project/vllm, sgl-project/sglang,
huggingface/transformers all keep ≤ 15 narrative .md files in
their main docs tree). The consolidated files map to the previous
38 as follows:

- `QUICKSTART.md` ← `QUICKSTART.md` (rewritten) + `DAY_1_CHECKLIST.md`.
- `CLI_REFERENCE.md` ← `CLI_REFERENCE.md` + `COMMANDS.md` + `SELF_TEST.md`.
- `MODELS.md` ← `MODELS.md` + `CONFIGS_FOR_COMMUNITY.md` + `CONFIG_SYSTEM_V2.md`.
- `PATCHES.md` ← `PATCHES.md` + `COMPATIBILITY.md` + `PATCH_PLAN.md`.
- `PATCH_DESIGNS.md` ← `GDN_KERNEL_FUSION_DESIGN.md` + `PATH_C_TIER_AWARE_KV_CACHE.md` + `REASONING_CONTENT_CONTRACT.md` + `MIGRATION_V11_RENAME.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` ← `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `PLUGINS.md` + `COMMUNITY_PATCHES.md` + `PROJECT_MAP.md`.
- `BENCHMARKS.md` ← `BENCHMARKS.md` + `BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md`.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (new) ← `CLIFFS.md` + `OOM_RECIPES.md` + `COOKBOOK.md` + `ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md`.

Plus 4 dated Russian-language audit files removed from
`docs/upstream/` (preserved in git history).
