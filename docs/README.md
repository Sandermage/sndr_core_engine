# `docs/` — Documentation Map

Public documentation for Genesis vLLM Patches. The top-level
`README.md` covers the headline project description; this folder
holds every operator-facing and contributor-facing reference.
Internal planning notes live in a gitignored sibling directory and
never ship publicly.

## Subdirectories

| Folder | What's inside |
| --- | --- |
| [`img/`](img/) | Diagrams referenced from the narrative docs (DFlash vs MTP, patch impact, per-config perf). |

The previous `reference/`, `security/`, `upstream/`, and
`upstream_refs/` subdirectories were retired in the 2026-05-16
consolidation pass:

- Historical experiment / deferred-work logs from 2026-04-27
  (`reference/`) were preserved in git history and removed from
  the public surface — they were operator-irrelevant snapshots.
- The Ed25519 trust-anchor ceremony (`security/`) was an internal
  artefact for a future license-tier that does not gate any
  public-core functionality.
- `upstream/STABLE_PROMOTION_CHECKLIST.md` was merged into
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md` § "Promoting a patch to `lifecycle=stable`"](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- `upstream/UPSTREAM_WATCHLIST.yaml` (consumed by
  `scripts/audit_upstream_watchlist.py`) moved to
  [`tools/upstream_watchlist.yaml`](../tools/upstream_watchlist.yaml)
  because it is a data file, not narrative documentation.
- `upstream/VLLM_PR_DECISION.md` was a historical 2026-04-26
  decision document preserved in git history.
- `upstream_refs/` (frozen vLLM source snapshots used as
  text-patch anchor references) was maintainer-side reference
  material with no operator-facing value; moved off the public
  tree entirely. Contributors authoring a new text-patch should
  pull upstream code directly via
  `git show vllm-project/vllm:<path>@<sha>` instead of reading
  pre-saved snapshots.

## Top-level repo docs (one folder up)

| Doc | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`../README.md`](../README.md) | Project overview, quick install, hardware tested, architecture. |
| [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) | Per-version changelog (technical, deep — single source of truth). |
| [`../CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | Top-level contributor onboarding (links here). |
| [`../SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) | Security policy + private disclosure email. |
| [`../LICENSE`](../LICENSE) | Apache-2.0. |

## Auto-generated content

Two files are regenerated from canonical sources by CI gates:

- [`PATCHES_AUTO.md`](PATCHES_AUTO.md) —
  `python3 scripts/generate_patches_md.py`
- [`CONFIGS_AUTO.md`](CONFIGS_AUTO.md) —
  `python3 scripts/generate_configs_md.py`

Do not edit these by hand — the `--check` mode of each generator
gates pull requests. The matching narrative files
([`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md), [`CONFIGS.md`](CONFIGS.md)) capture
the explanations that don't fit in a machine-readable table.

## Consolidation history

The previous structure had 38 markdown files. After the 2026-05-16
consolidation pass, sibling topics were merged into single
operator-facing references so the surface matches industry-standard
docs/ layouts (vllm-project/vllm, sgl-project/sglang,
huggingface/transformers all keep ≤ 15 narrative .md files in
their main docs tree). The current 21 files map to the previous
38 as follows:

- `QUICKSTART.md` ← `QUICKSTART.md` (rewritten) + `DAY_1_CHECKLIST.md`.
- `CLI_REFERENCE.md` ← `CLI_REFERENCE.md` + `COMMANDS.md` + `SELF_TEST.md`.
- `MODELS.md` ← `MODELS.md` + `CONFIGS_FOR_COMMUNITY.md` + `CONFIG_SYSTEM_V2.md`.
- `PATCHES.md` ← `PATCHES.md` + `COMPATIBILITY.md` + `PATCH_PLAN.md`.
- `PATCH_DESIGNS.md` ← `GDN_KERNEL_FUSION_DESIGN.md` + `PATH_C_TIER_AWARE_KV_CACHE.md` + `REASONING_CONTENT_CONTRACT.md` + `MIGRATION_V11_RENAME.md`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` ← `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `PLUGINS.md` + `COMMUNITY_PATCHES.md` + `PROJECT_MAP.md`.
- `BENCHMARKS.md` ← `BENCHMARKS.md` + `BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md`.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (new) ← `CLIFFS.md` + `OOM_RECIPES.md` + `COOKBOOK.md` + `ROLLBACK_PLAYBOOK.md`.

Plus 4 dated Russian-language audit files removed from
`docs/upstream/` (preserved in git history).
