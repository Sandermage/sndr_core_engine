# Sponsorship

Genesis vLLM Patches is developed and maintained by
[Sandermage (Aleksandr Barzov)](https://github.com/Sandermage) in
Odessa, Ukraine. The code is Apache-2.0 and will always remain
open; this page exists for people who have asked how to support
the work — both the maintainer's time and the project's
cross-platform test bench.

> Sponsorship is voluntary and carries no obligations on either
> side. Genesis has no premium tiers, no paywalled patches, and no
> priority queues — past and future contributions buy access to the
> same public docs and issue tracker as everyone else. Support
> simply gives the maintainer room to engage with the project more
> deeply and to keep developing its functionality and capabilities.

## What sponsorship enables

Genesis is a one-maintainer project funded out of the maintainer's
own savings and developed alongside other commitments. Support
gives the project room along two natural axes — the maintainer's
time and the hardware available for validation.

### Time spent on the project

Working on Genesis is currently a part-time effort. Sponsorship
gives the maintainer space to engage with the project more deeply
and consistently, rather than fitting it around other paid work.
Practically, this means more room to develop existing functionality,
explore new directions on the registry side
([`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md)), advance the deferred architecture
work documented in [`PATCH_DESIGNS.md`](PATCH_DESIGNS.md), and stay
engaged with community issues and contributions.

How much of that actually happens scales with how much breathing
room sponsorship provides — there are no quotas, no promised
deliverables, and no per-donor service levels.

### Cross-platform hardware

Genesis is currently validated on the reference rig:
**2× NVIDIA RTX A5000** (Ampere SM 8.6, 24 GB each). Anything
beyond that envelope — Hopper, Blackwell, RTX PRO 6000, H100,
Intel XPU, AMD ROCm CDNA — ships with defensive `applies_to` guards
because there is no real silicon to validate against.

Access to more hardware (purchased through sponsorship, lent, or
donated) opens up room for the project to grow into platforms it
currently treats as "best-effort graceful skip" — see
[`RELEASE_POLICY.md`](RELEASE_POLICY.md) for the proof-artefact
ratchet that tracks this expansion.

## How to support

### Financial channels

| Channel | Address |
| --- | --- |
| USDT (BEP-20) | `0x1E8C74aC4f37A201733D185b2303e9D69f305306` |
| USDT (TRC-20) | `TSyVYTA4PK22w3tZ7vgoc1itjXU5p4Vfks` |
| ETH (mainnet) | `0x1E8C74aC4f37A201733D185b2303e9D69f305306` |
| BTC | `bc1q9tau6xqgrv5jjgst63yjux550gslq6nm7y7q9f` |
| PayPal | `sander.odessa@gmail.com` |

These channels are personal and suit individual contributions.

### Business sponsorship and invoicing

Sponsors whose accounting or compliance workflows require a formal
counterparty — invoices, a registered recipient, structured KYC —
can write to `sander.odessa@gmail.com` to discuss options:

- Routing through a Ukrainian sole-proprietor (ФОП) account is
  available on request.
- For larger engagements where the sponsor's requirements call for
  it, registering an LLC in a jurisdiction agreeable to both sides
  can be arranged.

Exact terms (entity, jurisdiction, invoicing format, KYC documents)
are agreed case by case via email. The maintainer is not a tax or
legal advisor — each side is responsible for its own compliance
and reporting obligations under its local law.

### Hardware loan or donation

If you have a Hopper / Blackwell / RTX PRO 6000 / H100 / Intel XPU /
AMD ROCm card you can lend or donate to the project, write to
`sander.odessa@gmail.com` to discuss logistics. Loaned hardware is
returned when the validation cycle finishes; donated hardware
becomes part of the project's permanent test bench and shows up in
the acknowledgments below.

### Cross-rig bench reports

Bench JSONs from rigs not yet in
[`tests/integration/baselines/`](../tests/integration/baselines/)
are valuable contributions in their own right — no money required.
See [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md) for the run-and-share guide.

## Maintainer commitments

- Everything in the community wheel (`vllm-sndr-core`) stays under
  Apache-2.0, including bench results, methodology, and raw logs.
- Every upstream author and contributor is credited in
  [`CREDITS.md`](CREDITS.md) and inside individual patch docstrings.
- No functionality will ever be gated behind sponsorship,
  paywalls, or premium tiers in the community wheel.
- Support does not buy maintainer time, custom features, or
  priority on the issue tracker.

## Sponsorship and the reserved commercial engine wheel

Genesis reserves a separate namespace, `vllm/sndr_engine/`, that
builds as an independent wheel (`vllm-sndr-engine`) under a
commercial license. It is currently **reserved but empty** — no
patches qualify as engine-tier under the strict-AND rule in
[`PATCHES.md`](PATCHES.md#engine-tier-the-strict-and-boundary).
The namespace exists so that, if a future clean-room maintainer-
original contribution ever fits, there is a defined zone for it
without disturbing the Apache-2.0 community wheel.

What sponsorship explicitly **does not** do:

- Sponsorship is **not** a license to the commercial engine wheel.
  If `vllm-sndr-engine` ever gains content, it ships as a distinct
  paid product with its own pricing, governed by
  [`LICENSE_POLICY.md`](LICENSE_POLICY.md). Sponsors are not granted
  preferential access, early builds, or discounted terms.
- Sponsorship does **not** influence what goes into the engine wheel
  vs the community wheel. The strict-AND classification is fixed by
  upstream provenance (PR link, external credit, byte-equivalence
  with upstream), not by funding source.

What this means in practice: contributing financially to Genesis
supports the **community wheel and its maintainer's time on the
public project**. The reserved commercial wheel is a separate
matter; today it ships nothing, and if that changes, the
commercial offering will be published as a stand-alone product
with its own announcement and terms.

## Security contact

Security disclosures follow the project's
[`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) policy — email
`sander.odessa@gmail.com` privately rather than opening a public
issue.

## Acknowledgments

Past supporters and hardware sponsors will be listed here as
sponsorship arrives. The list is opt-in — contributors can request
attribution or stay anonymous. To opt in, mention the preferred
display name when you reach out.
