"""SNDR Core env-flag registry — single source of truth for ALL env vars.

Per Sander Q4 decision (2026-05-07): all flags enumerated as constants
on the `Flags` class. `is_enabled()` adds the right prefix at lookup
time and supports back-compat between SNDR_ENABLE_* and GENESIS_ENABLE_*.

Per Sander Q2 decision (2026-05-07, mixed branding):
  - Backport patches keep `GENESIS_ENABLE_*` env name.
  - Sander-original (tier=engine) patches use `SNDR_ENABLE_*` canonical.
  - Both prefixes are recognized by `is_enabled()`. SNDR_* wins if
    BOTH are set (giving Sander-IP override priority on community
    deployments).

Why this file exists:
  Before Stage 2, each of 102 patch wirings rolled its own
    `os.environ.get("GENESIS_ENABLE_<flag>", "").strip().lower() in ("1", ...)`
  - No registry of "what flags exist" → typos silent (typoed flag
    just defaults off).
  - No SNDR_/GENESIS_ aliasing → tier=engine patches stuck with
    GENESIS_ branding.
  - No type-checking of flag names → drift between docstrings and code.

Now:
  - `Flags` class — every known flag enumerated as a class constant.
  - `is_enabled(flag, default)` — checks SNDR_ENABLE_* THEN GENESIS_ENABLE_*.
  - `known_flags()` — list for `sndr list-flags` CLI.
  - `boot_audit()` — warns on env vars that look like flags but aren't
    in the registry (catches typos like SNDR_ENABLE_P61C_DEFERED_COMMIT).

Migration status:
  Stage 2 (CURRENT) — registry created; legacy `os.environ.get()` calls
                      in patches still work unchanged.
  Stage 6+        — patches migrate to `is_enabled(Flags.X)`.
  Stage 13        — boot_audit becomes mandatory in apply orchestrator.

class Flags:
    """All SNDR Core / Genesis env flags as named constants.

    Each constant value is the bare flag name (without prefix).
    `is_enabled()` adds `SNDR_ENABLE_` or `GENESIS_ENABLE_` at lookup.

    Convention:
      - Group by patch family (alphabetical within group).
      - Constant name mirrors patch ID + descriptive suffix.
      - Constant value matches what's currently in dispatcher.PATCH_REGISTRY
        (1:1 mapping for back-compat — Stage 5+ may normalize names).

    Adding a new flag:
      1. Add constant here in the right family group.
      2. Reference via `is_enabled(Flags.X)` from the patch.
      3. Register in dispatcher entry with `env_flag = Flags.X`.
