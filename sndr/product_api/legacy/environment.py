"""Runtime environment + version report for the admin dashboard.

Reports the SNDR Core project version, the vLLM engine version, the dependency
stack and runtime-tool availability. Versions come from installed package
metadata (``importlib.metadata``) — we never import vLLM/torch and never run a
subprocess, so this stays cheap and torch-free.
