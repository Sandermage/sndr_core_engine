"""Read-only Product API capability inventory for GUI and web callers.

This module answers "what can this checkout expose to an operator UI?"
without launching containers, probing GPUs, importing SNDR Engine, or
printing. Runtime tool checks use ``shutil.which`` only, so the function is
safe on macOS/Linux/Windows development hosts.
