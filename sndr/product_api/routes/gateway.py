"""OpenAI-compatible memory gateway (`POST /v1/chat/completions`).

Clients point here instead of directly at the upstream; the gateway transparently
adds memory to EVERY model (the единое-ядро layer):

    client -> /v1/chat/completions -> recall+inject -> upstream -> capture -> client

Upstream is set by env (the unmodified CLIProxyAPI for external models, or the
vLLM OpenAI server for the internal 35B):
  * GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_URL  e.g. http://cliproxy:8317/v1  (or http://127.0.0.1:8102/v1)
  * GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_KEY  bearer token the upstream expects (optional)

The actual upstream call lives on `app.state.gateway_forward` / `gateway_stream`
(set by create_app from env, overridable in tests), so this route is verifiable
without a live upstream. Owner scoping via the X-Owner-Id header.
