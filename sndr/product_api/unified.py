"""Unified daemon: the full Control Center + persistent memory in one app.

During the v11→v12 migration the platform routes still live in the legacy
monolith (:mod:`sndr.product_api.legacy.http_app`, ~197 routes) while the
persistent-memory subsystem lives in the modular routers. Neither app alone is a
superset of what the GUI calls, so a single-daemon deployment 404s on one half.

This factory COMPOSES them — it builds the unchanged legacy app and mounts the
memory + gateway routers onto it — giving the "main Control Center daemon WITH
memory" the GUI needs, without editing the monolith (so it neither inherits the
legacy lint backlog nor risks the 197 working routes). Run it with::

    uvicorn sndr.product_api.unified:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8800

Phase 11 proper will migrate the legacy routes into the modular ``server``; until
then this composition is the superset daemon.
