"""Shared anchor discovery — the single enumerator of "what to anchor".

This module owns the patch→patcher→anchor enumeration that was previously
private to ``tools/check_upstream_drift.py``. Both the drift-checker and the
per-pin manifest generator import from here, so there is exactly ONE place
that decides which patches/anchors exist (satisfies design requirement R1:
100% coverage of all anchor-bearing patches — no hand-typed subset).

Design: ``sndr/engines/vllm/anchor_discovery.py`` (lib) is imported by
``tools/check_upstream_drift.py`` (tool) and ``scripts/build_anchor_manifest.py``
(tool). Libs are never imported FROM tools — the dependency points one way.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-anchor-sot-design.md (Phase 1).
