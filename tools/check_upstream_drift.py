"""D1 — Genesis upstream anchor-drift watcher (runtime-parity redesign).

Checks every Genesis text-patch / import-wiring against an upstream vllm
checkout and reports which patches need re-anchoring before the next pin
bump. The 2026-06-13 rewrite makes the STATIC check match RUNTIME reality
(``TextPatcher.apply()``): the old tool false-positived on every applied
patch (post-apply the anchor is gone) and false-negatived whole patch
classes (inline-builder + import-wiring patches it never looked at).

What "runtime parity" means
---------------------------
``TextPatcher.apply()`` short-circuits BEFORE the anchor scan with three
gates the old tool ignored. We replicate them so a patch the engine would
legitimately skip is never reported as drift:

  * Layer 2 — marker idempotency. If the patcher's ``marker`` is already
    in the file, apply() returns IDEMPOTENT. → status ``already_applied``.
  * Layer 3 — ``upstream_drift_markers``. If any is present, apply()
    returns SKIPPED (upstream merged the fix). → status ``upstream_merged``
    (retire, not drift).
  * Version gate — the dispatcher
    (``decision._check_applies_to`` → ``version_check.check_version_constraints``)
    skips a patch whose ``applies_to.vllm_version_range`` excludes the
    running pin. We evaluate the SAME constraint against the TREE's pin.
    → status ``version_gated_skip`` (excluded from the drift count).

This is exactly why ~164 patches "skip" at boot — they are version-gated,
NOT drifted.

Pristine-tree requirement
--------------------------
The check is only meaningful against a PRISTINE upstream clone (pre-apply
anchors present, no Genesis markers). Running against the deployed/patched
tree is structurally guaranteed to false-positive (each applied patch has
already deleted its own anchor and written its marker). The tool now
REFUSES (exit 2) to run against a tree that carries Genesis wiring markers.

Patch-class coverage (false-negatives closed)
----------------------------------------------
  1. Module-level ``_make_patcher()`` — the classic text-patch wiring.
  2. Inline-builder patches (e.g. PN347) that build their ``TextPatcher``
     inside ``apply()``. They opt in via ``_make_patcher_for_drift()``.
  3. Import-wiring monkey-patches (e.g. PN287) whose real drift vector is
     the engine moving/renaming the parser class module (exactly what
     vllm#45413 / #45588 did). They opt in via a ``_parser_targets()``-style
     accessor; if NO candidate module/class resolves under the tree the
     patch reports ``import_drift``.

Exit semantics
--------------
  0 — no genuine drift.
  1 — genuine drift detected: any anchor with status in
      {anchor_drift, import_drift}. (operator action required)
  2 — invocation error: bad path, patched tree, or --expect-pin mismatch.

Whitespace-only / needs-fixture / unbuildable cases go to a separate
NON-BLOCKING warnings bucket and never drive a non-zero exit.

Usage
-----
    python3 tools/check_upstream_drift.py <pristine-vllm-clone> \
        [--expect-pin <ver>] [--json] [--quiet]

``--expect-pin <ver>`` is read against ``<root>/vllm/_version.py`` (then
``version.py``). When the tree declares a concrete pin it is a GUARD —
a mismatch exits 2 so the gate can never silently drift-check the wrong
pin/tree. When the tree declares no concrete pin (a fresh ``git clone``
whose vcs-generated ``_version.py`` is absent), ``--expect-pin`` doubles
as the operator-asserted gating pin so version-gating still runs.

D1 design constraint: read-only against upstream clone. Never mutate.
