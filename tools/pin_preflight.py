"""Pin-bump preflight — read-only readiness report for a CANDIDATE vllm tree.

Given a pristine vllm package tree extracted from a candidate image (see
``tools/extract_candidate_tree.sh``), evaluate EVERY active Genesis patch
against it WITHOUT applying anything and WITHOUT touching PROD:

  - Text-patchers: build via each wiring module's ``_make*patcher()``
    builders under a redirected install root, then mirror the apply()
    decision layers READ-ONLY (Layer 2 marker / Layer 3 drift markers /
    Layer 5 anchor scan via a pure reimplementation of
    ``TextPatcher._apply_layer5_legacy`` — behavior parity is pinned by
    ``tests/unit/tools/test_pin_preflight.py::TestLayer5Parity``).
    ``TextPatcher.apply()`` is NEVER called — it writes to disk.
  - Runtime-hook modules (no text-patcher builder): static AST extraction
    of their ``vllm.*`` import bindings, checked for file/symbol presence
    in the candidate tree. Static only — call-site liveness still needs
    in-container verification (rows carry ``VERIFY_IN_CONTAINER``).
  - Tree-wide passes: ``UPSTREAM_MARKERS`` merge detection, per-patch
    ``applies_to.vllm_version_range`` gating against the candidate's
    internal version, anchor-manifest staleness, and a SELF_COLLISION
    static lint (the PN369 class: a patcher's own replacement text or
    marker matching one of its upstream_drift_markers).

Verdicts per patcher:
  OK                  — every required anchor matches exactly once
  DRIFT_ANCHOR        — a required anchor is absent (count == 0)
  AMBIGUOUS_ANCHOR    — an anchor matches more than once
  DRIFT_FILE_MOVED    — target file missing, or builder returned None
                        with a resolve target actually absent
                        (report carries up to 3 moved-to candidates)
  UPSTREAM_MERGED     — patcher-level upstream_drift_marker present
  SUB_UPSTREAM_MERGED — per-sub upstream_merged_markers fired
  STALE_RESIDUE       — patch marker already present in a PRISTINE tree
                        (impossible unless residue or marker collision)
  ENV_GATED_ABSTAIN   — builder returned None even with its registry
                        env_flag forced to "1" AND every
                        resolve_vllm_file literal exists — the abstain
                        is gated on something beyond the flag, not on
                        file drift (v1.2, non-actionable)
  KNOWN_OPTIONAL_RETIRED — all-required=False patcher with zero anchor
                        matches whose every sub name is declared
                        retired-by-design via the wiring module's
                        ``*_RETIRED_SUBS`` attr (v1.2, non-actionable;
                        the P64 serving-patcher steady state)
  EXPECTED_ALTERNATE  — zero-match patcher whose every sub is declared
                        a per-pin variant via the wiring module's
                        ``*_ANCHOR_ALTERNATION`` dict attr AND whose
                        declared alternate sub matched in a sibling
                        row of the same module (v1.3, non-actionable;
                        the P91B dual-factory dev338/dev371 class —
                        exactly one inc.py anchor matches on any live
                        pin by design)
  UNBUILDABLE         — builder has required params we will not guess
                        (v1.2: a param <name> IS fillable when the
                        module exposes a callable ``_read_<name>`` —
                        the P82 apply() convention)
  IMPORT_FAIL         — wiring module failed to import
  RUNTIME_BINDING     — no text-patcher; static binding check only

v1.2 (2026-06-11, residual-triage action plan §4): rows built only
after an env-forced builder retry carry ``env_forced: true``; rows
whose required builder params were filled through the ``_read_<name>``
convention carry ``params_filled_via``.

v1.3 (2026-06-11, P91B alternation manifest): module-declared
anchor-alternation via ``*_ANCHOR_ALTERNATION`` (sub name → alternate
sub names). Reclassifies the non-matching per-pin factory variant from
DRIFT_ANCHOR to EXPECTED_ALTERNATE when the OTHER variant matched;
rows carry ``alternate_matched``. A miss on EVERY variant stays
DRIFT_ANCHOR — fail-noisy, never fail-silent.

Usage:
    python3 tools/pin_preflight.py <candidate_root> \
        [--provenance <path>] [--json-out <path>] [--fail-fast]

``<candidate_root>`` is the directory CONTAINING the vllm package
contents (i.e. ``<candidate_root>/v1`` must exist — typically
``<staging>/vllm`` produced by extract_candidate_tree.sh).

Exit codes:
    0 — all patches OK / runtime bindings resolve / no new merges
    1 — at least one actionable verdict (drift, merge, residue, ...)
    2 — invocation error (bad root, unreadable provenance, ...)

Fully offline by default — no gh API, no docker, no SSH.
