"""§4.2 V2 patch-lifecycle coverage gate.

For each V2 `kind: model` YAML, every `GENESIS_ENABLE_<X>_*: '1'` flag
maps via PATCH_REGISTRY to a `lifecycle` field
(stable / experimental / legacy / retired / research / coordinator).
Enabling a `lifecycle: retired` patch in production config is a
hygiene issue — the code path runs but is no longer actively maintained.

This gate surfaces enabled-retired patches per V2 model. Default mode
is **informational** (warn, don't block) because:

  • Retired patches may still ship working code (retirement is a
    maintenance signal, not a "removed" signal).
  • Operator may legitimately keep one enabled until a known
    replacement lands.

To make it gating, change the GATES entry severity, OR add specific
patch_ids to the `ALLOWED_RETIRED_PATCHES` allowlist with a comment
explaining why.

Survey at E30 time found three enabled retired patches in committed
V2 models: PN19, PN52, P94. These are added to the allowlist below
with operator context. Future drift (a NEW retired patch enabled
without allowlist entry) flags.

Exit codes:
  0 — no out-of-allowlist retired patches enabled
  1 — at least one out-of-allowlist retired/disallowed patch enabled
  2 — internal error
