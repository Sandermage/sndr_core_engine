"""Source-code docs/ reference integrity — Phase 10.5 D-extension 2026-06-01.

Catches stale ``docs/<name>.md`` references that live in Python source
(error messages, docstrings, configuration fields, comments) but point
at a markdown file that does not exist in the tracked tree.

Why this gate exists
--------------------

The companion ``audit_links.py`` gate walks tracked markdown files and
verifies every inline link resolves cleanly. It catches the
post-consolidation rot we hit during the 2026-05-16 doc reshape (the
``CLIFFS.md / OOM_RECIPES.md / BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md`` merges into
``TROUBLESHOOTING.md + BENCHMARKS.md``) — but only for ``.md → .md``
links. References that live in **Python source** (e.g. operator-facing
``FileNotFoundError`` messages, configuration ``references=[...]``
fields, module-level pointer docstrings) survive the same merge
without an audit gate noticing. The 2026-06-01 enterprise sweep found
four stale ``BENCHMARK_GUIDE.md`` refs in ``compat/bench.py`` +
``tools/genesis_bench_suite.py`` exactly this way — they pointed at a
doc that had been merged into ``BENCHMARKS.md`` six weeks earlier and
operators on slim deployments saw the broken hint at the wrong moment
(when the bench script could not be located).

How the gate works
------------------

  1. Walks every ``.py`` file under ``vllm/sndr_core/`` (skipping
     ``_retired/`` + ``__pycache__/``).
  2. Greps for ``docs/<name>.md`` substrings using a token-boundary
     regex (so ``Genesis_internal_docs/X.md`` does NOT spuriously
     match as ``docs/X.md``).
  3. Skips refs that start with ``docs/_internal/`` — that's the
     gitignored private maintainer tree, expected absent in the
     public checkout.
  4. For each remaining ref, checks if the corresponding markdown
     file is in ``git ls-files`` output. Misses are reported.

Default mode: **warn only** (exit 0 even on misses). The operator
checks the report and either creates the missing doc, redirects the
reference at a canonical replacement, or accepts the miss as
aspirational. ``--strict`` promotes warnings to errors for CI.

Exit codes
----------

  0 — warn-only mode (default) OR ``--strict`` with zero misses.
  1 — ``--strict`` mode + at least one broken ref.
  2 — internal error (git unavailable / filesystem).
