"""V2 runtime / ModelDef pin harmonization audit.

After P2.3 unified all hardware YAMLs on a single dev371 runtime image
and a3fa5265 wired the renderer to honor `hw.runtime.docker.image`,
this script locks the invariants in place so the discipline survives
the next pin bump:

  R-PIN-1 — no bare mutable vLLM nightly under
            ``vllm/sndr_core/model_configs/builtin/hardware/*.yaml``.
            Hardware YAMLs must pin an explicit-hash tag (or
            digest-backed tag), never the floating ``:nightly`` /
            ``:latest`` / ``:main`` aliases.

  R-PIN-2 — every hardware YAML that declares ``runtime.docker.image``
            must also declare a non-empty ``runtime.docker.image_digest``
            beginning with ``vllm/vllm-openai@sha256:``. The digest is
            the byte-locked anchor; the tag is for human readability.

  R-PIN-3 — rendered launcher's IMAGE line must equal the composed
            ``cfg.docker.image`` for representative profiles. P2.1
            wired the renderer to read ``hw.runtime.docker.image``
            verbatim, and compose() carries the same value into
            ``cfg.docker.image``. This rule is a regression gate
            against a future refactor that re-introduces a hardcoded
            fallback or a parallel image-resolution path.

  R-PIN-4 — ModelDef pin migration status. Every ModelDef pin must be
            in ``ALLOWED_MODELDEF_PINS`` (a value outside it fails,
            catching stale pins or typos). Reconciled 2026-06-24
            (pin bump dev148 -> dev301): the whole fleet is unified on
            the canonical pin
            (``CANONICAL_PIN_SUBSTRING``, currently dev301). The audit
            classifies each ModelDef into a ``canonical`` /  ``dev338``
            (legacy baseline) / ``dev371`` (legacy sprint era) /
            ``other`` bucket and reports the migration table as info.
            DFlash and placeholder hold semantics now attach to the
            canonical bucket; the dev338 / dev371 buckets are retained
            so a rolled-back tree still classifies correctly.

The script is idempotent and read-only — it never modifies files,
registry, or git state.

Exit codes:

  0 — all selected rules pass (clean tree, allowed migration state).
  1 — at least one violation found.
  2 — audit tooling itself failed (import error, missing dependency).

# migration baseline; dev371 / 626fa9bba5 were the prior-canonical sprint
# era; both are now history, retained only as classifier buckets so the
# audit still reads a (hypothetical) rolled-back tree correctly.
#
# The classifier now recognizes THREE meaningful states:
#   * canonical  — the current fleet-unified pin (substring match below)

#   * dev371     — prior-canonical sprint era (legacy)

#
#   Value error, customized max_cudagraph_capture_size(=8) should be

#
# dev338 did not enforce the cross-validation rule, so the mismatch

#
# Hold lifted 2026-05-21 (M7) after PN275 (DFlash drafter VllmConfig

# AND M6 (commit 12d901a5) added `GENESIS_ENABLE_PN275_DFLASH_MAX_CGS_ALIGN: '1'`
# to BOTH DFlash ModelDef patches matrices, making the compat layer
# a hard prerequisite of each DFlash boot on dev371.
#
# With the hold lifted:
#   * DFlash dev371 promotions are PERMITTED — R-PIN-4 no longer
#     errors on them.
#   * DFlash dev338 entries are treated as ordinary "P2.4d candidate"
