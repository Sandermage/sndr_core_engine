"""Upstream PR status audit for iron-rule-#11 compliance.

Walks PATCH_REGISTRY, extracts every patch with `upstream_pr: N`,
queries GitHub for that PR's merge state, cross-references with the
patch's lifecycle / vllm_version_range / superseded_by fields, and
surfaces:

  - NEWLY-MERGED:    upstream merged BUT our lifecycle != "retired"
                     (iron-rule-#11 deep-diff queue)
  - STALE-RETIRED:   lifecycle == "retired" but upstream still OPEN
                     (premature retire? — investigate)
  - WATCH:           upstream still OPEN, our patch active (normal)
  - SUPERSEDED-OK:   already retired with provenance (no action)
  - NO-PR:           patch has no upstream_pr (Genesis-original — no
                     action needed)

Why this exists
---------------
Iron rule #11 (Sander 2026-05-11) requires deep-diff verification on
every pin bump. Previously the boot-time wiring drift detector was the
only signal that a patch had been superseded — that's reactive. This
script is proactive: catches retire-eligible patches before the next
bump, and flags premature retires before they hide regressions.

Usage
-----
  python3 scripts/audit_upstream_status.py
      Full report, table + counts.

  python3 scripts/audit_upstream_status.py --json
      Machine-readable output for CI / dashboards.

  python3 scripts/audit_upstream_status.py --filter newly-merged
      Only show the actionable queue.

  python3 scripts/audit_upstream_status.py --skip-network
      Use cached results only (for offline / fast-fail CI).

Requirements
------------
- `gh` CLI authenticated (uses gh api → GitHub REST v3)
- python3 stdlib only

CI hook (suggested)
-------------------
Add to `.github/workflows/upstream_audit.yml`:

  schedule:
    - cron: '0 7 * * 1'  # Monday 07:00 UTC weekly
  jobs:
    audit:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - run: python3 scripts/audit_upstream_status.py --filter newly-merged

When the report surfaces NEWLY-MERGED entries, run the iron-rule-#11
workflow: deep-diff our patch vs upstream code → retire OR update.

_PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS = frozenset({"backport"})
"""Relationship values that permit *status-based* retire scoring.

A patch with `upstream_pr_relationship in _PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS`
AND upstream PR merged AND lifecycle active is a `RETIRE-CANDIDATE`.
Iron-rule-#11 deep-diff is still REQUIRED before the actual retire —
the relationship being pure only means status alone is sufficient to put
the patch in the deep-diff queue.

Every OTHER relationship value signals that upstream coverage is NOT a
straight superset of Genesis runtime logic — the patch may guard a
regression, invert upstream behavior, live at a different layer, or
provide an env-gated convenience over upstream. For those, status alone
is NOT a retire signal. They classify as `NEEDS-DEEP-PARITY` and the
default verdict is KEEP unless a separate parity proof exists.

This constant codifies the discipline operator established after the
2026-05-23 sidecleanup audit, where 5 patches with merged upstream PRs
were initially proposed for retire by an agent reading PR dates only —
all 5 turned out to be non-pure relationships (intentional_inverse,
enables_upstream, defensive_overlay, related_not_superseding) that
would have caused regressions if retired blindly.

================================================================
EXTENSION PROTOCOL — adding a new `upstream_pr_relationship` value
================================================================

When a future patch class needs a relationship value not in the current
six, follow this protocol so the audit + retire logic stays coherent:

1. Pick a short, unambiguous identifier in `snake_case` (e.g.
   `redundant`, `pre_emptive`). The value must describe the SEMANTIC
   relationship between Genesis patch and the cited upstream PR, not
   the operational outcome.

2. Decide *status-based retire eligibility*:
   - If a merged upstream PR alone is sufficient signal that Genesis
     patch is safe to retire (subject to iron-rule-#11 deep-diff) →
     ADD the new value to `_PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS` here.
   - If upstream PR merge does NOT imply Genesis safety → LEAVE
     `_PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS` alone. The new value will
     automatically route to `NEEDS-DEEP-PARITY` via the default branch.

3. Register the value in `vllm/sndr_core/dispatcher/spec.py` →
   `VALID_UPSTREAM_PR_RELATIONSHIPS` tuple with a one-line trailing
   comment describing when to use it.

4. Update `retire_eligibility()` below if the new value needs custom
   bucket routing distinct from the default `NEEDS-DEEP-PARITY` /
   `RETIRE-CANDIDATE` / `ACTIVE` / `ALREADY-RETIRED` / `UNKNOWN`
   verdicts. Most additions will NOT need this — the default split
   on `in _PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS` is sufficient.

5. Update `categorize()` bucket label if the new value warrants its own
   audit-output bucket (e.g. so reviewers see at-a-glance which patches
   carry it). Otherwise it folds into `WATCH` / `NEEDS-DEEP-PARITY`.

6. Add a test case in `tests/unit/dispatcher/test_retire_eligibility.py`
   (or equivalent) that pins the new value's bucket routing. The test
   suite locks both `_PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS` membership and the
   resulting `retire_eligibility()` return.

7. Document the rationale in a `sndr_private/planning/audits/PHASE_*_
   RELATIONSHIP_*_RU.md` design note: when this value should be used,
   what registry-credit pattern accompanies it, what deep-parity proof
   discharges its NEEDS-DEEP-PARITY verdict (if applicable).

8. Use the new value in at least one registry entry, with `credit`
   field explicitly explaining why this value (not a simpler
   alternative) applies to that patch. This anchors the policy to a
   concrete example.

The audit script itself should NOT need a code change for steps 3-5
in the common case — the `_PURE_UPSTREAM_RELATIONSHIPS` membership
check is the single decision point. Steps 4-5 only apply when the new
value carries semantic state that the existing 5-bucket taxonomy
cannot express.

                             deep-diff REQUIRED before any actual retire.
                             This is the only verdict that authorizes
                             putting a patch in the retire queue.
      "NEEDS-DEEP-PARITY"  — upstream PR merged AND our patch's relationship

                             related_not_superseding). PR-status alone is
                             INSUFFICIENT to retire. Default verdict KEEP
                             unless a separate deep parity audit proves
                             equivalence.
      "ACTIVE"             — upstream PR still open AND our patch
                             lifecycle is active. No retire action.
      "ALREADY-RETIRED"    — our patch lifecycle is "retired". Action
                             already complete.
      "UNKNOWN"            — issue reference, PR query error, or other
                             state that cannot be auto-classified.

    Implementation: derives the verdict from `categorize()`'s bucket so
    the two stay in lockstep. Adding a new audit bucket requires updating
    this mapping; the test suite locks both surfaces.

    Lifecycle override: when our patch is already `retired`, the verdict
    is ALWAYS ALREADY-RETIRED regardless of bucket. The bucket is then a
    purely informational record (e.g. `RELATED-NOT-SUPERSEDING` on an
    open PR documents why the retire happened without that PR). No deep-
    parity work is meaningful for a retired patch — it isn't applying.

    Operator contract: PIN.R recon scripts / agents MUST consult this
    function (or equivalent registry-aware filter) before producing a
    "retire-NOW" list. Reading PR merge dates without consulting
    `upstream_pr_relationship` produces false positives — see
    docs/_internal/PIN_R_SIDECLEANUP_DEEP_PARITY_AUDIT for the empirical
