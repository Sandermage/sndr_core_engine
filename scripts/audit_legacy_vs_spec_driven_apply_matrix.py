"""Empirical comparison: legacy apply orchestrator vs spec-driven path.

Phase 6 P3.4 v12.0.0 readiness — per scout finding, the v12.0.0 default
flip from PATCH_REGISTRY list iteration to iter_patch_specs() must be
validated to produce IDENTICAL boot behaviour.

This script runs both paths in a dry-run mode (no actual vLLM, no torch
side effects) and compares:

- Apply matrix: which patches each path tried, what verdict each got
- Order: did the spec-driven path apply patches in the same sequence
  as the legacy path?
- Reason text: did the skip/applied reasons match?
- Coverage: did one path try patches the other didn't?

Output: structured JSON with full diff + human-readable summary.

Usage
-----

  # Show diff summary
  python3 scripts/audit_legacy_vs_spec_driven_apply_matrix.py

  # Emit full JSON for CI consumption
  python3 scripts/audit_legacy_vs_spec_driven_apply_matrix.py --json

  # Fail-fast mode — exit 1 on any divergence
  python3 scripts/audit_legacy_vs_spec_driven_apply_matrix.py --strict

Limitations
-----------

This is a STATIC structural comparison — it inspects what each path
WOULD iterate, not what each apply() function actually does. The
runtime mutation behaviour (text patches actually modifying upstream
files, monkey-patches taking effect) is not exercised. That requires
a real vLLM-equipped rig + side-by-side reboot bench.

What this DOES catch:
- Order divergence (different sequence between paths)
- Coverage divergence (one path tries patches the other doesn't)
- Patch-id mismatch (legacy "P67 Title" vs spec "P67 Title (compound)")

What this does NOT catch:
- Per-patch apply() behaviour divergence (needs rig)
- Side-effect ordering issues (needs rig)
- CUDA-graph capture interactions (needs rig)

# v11 history: ~41 modules applied via explicit env-gated
# `from .integrations.<...> import (mod as _alias); _alias.apply()`
# blocks at `vllm/sndr_core/__init__.py` import time. These did NOT go
# through the legacy `@register_patch` decorator and did NOT need
# `SNDR_APPLY_VIA_SPECS=1` to fire. Discovered via runtime logs on prod
# gemma4-31b container.
#
# v12: the legacy tree was archived (commit 6bf9c04c →
# `sndr_private/archive/v11_vllm_sndr_core_shims/`) and the import-time
# orchestration block was NOT carried over — the only remaining manual
# orchestration site is `sndr/plugin.py` (vllm general-plugin entry
# point) with its selective G4_19/G4_19b apply block, using canonical
# absolute imports (`from sndr.engines.vllm.patches.<sub> import (...)`).
#
# The audit must enumerate this third path so spec-only IDs that are
# actually applied via manual orchestration are not flagged as
# "would-silently-not-apply on v12.0.0 flip" — they ALREADY apply.
